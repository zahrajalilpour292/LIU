    "Disclaimer: Functional programming in Python does not always lead to the fastest possible code, and is often not considered the *pythonic* approach. However, functional programming is the basis for many concurrent systems (the MapReduce programming model which many big data systems, e.g. Hadoop, relies on gets its name from the *map* and *reduce* functions mentioned below). Python is a multi-paradigm language, and functional programming is one of the main paradigms one can use. To understand how and when to do this, it is necessary to do things in a non-*pythonic* way in order to cover the basics."

    "## General instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab there are some general rules you should keep in mind to make sure you are on the correct path in your solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Rules\n",
    "1. You are not allowed to use `while` or `for` statements unless this is explicitly allowed in the task.\n",
    "2. You are not allowed to use global variables (other than for functions defined in the global environment).\n",
    "3. Code stubs should be viewed as fixed, you are only allowed to add code, the only code you are allowed to change is `pass` statements, which you should remove.\n",
    "4. You should refrain from using the `list` datatype unless otherwise specified and instead use `tuple`. One of the strengths of functional programming is its focus on immutable data types (this is why functional programming and concurrency goes so well together). Incidentally, one might find speedups when using the immutable tuples instead of lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Advice\n",
    "1. Avoid local variables unless you are certain they are necessary, in most cases you won't need to use local variables. (altermatively, use local variables to your hearts content, but when your solution works, try to eliminate them, you should be able to eliminate most of them, over time, you might find that you don't need them.)"

    "## 3 Higher order functions (HOF)\n",
    " \n",
    "A _higher-order function_ is a function which operates on other functions. What this means exactly is disputed, but we will call any function which returns a function or takes a function as an argument a higher-order function. (Conversely, a function neither taking another function as input nor returning a function we will refer to as a _first-order function_)\n",
    "\n",
    "In R you have encountered these when, for instance, using the `apply` family of functions, which are all versions of what is called a `map` function in functional programming (see below).\n",
    "\n",
    "When using higher-order functions, it is often useful to create simple anonymous functions at the place in the code where they are used, rather than defining a new named function in one place only to call it in a single other place. In R, all functions are created in this way with the `function` keyword, but they are usually assigned to global names with standard assignment (`<-`). Python provides similar functionality using the `lambda` keyword (name inspired by Alonzo Church's [$\\lambda$-calculus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eis11j_iGMs) which has inspired much of functional programming) with which we can create anonymous functions. Of course, we can also pass named functions to higher-order functions, which is usually the case when the function is predefined, general enough to be used in more than one place, or complex enough to warrant separate definition and documentation for the sake of clarity."

    "## 3.1 The three standard functions `map`, `reduce` and `filter`\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three standard cases which are widely applicable and many other higher-order functions are special cases or combinations of these. They are: `map`, apply a function on each element in a sequence, `filter`, keep (or conversely, remove) elements from a sequence according to some condition, and `reduce`, combine the elements in a sequence. The `map` function takes a sequence and a function (usually of 1 parameter) which is to be applied to each element of the sequence and might return anything, this function is assumed not to have side effects. The `filter` function takes a function (usually of 1 parameter) which returns a boolean value used to indicate which elements are to be kept. The `reduce` function takes a function (usually of 2 parameters) which is used to combine the elements in the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, `map` and `filter` are standard built-in functions. Since Python 3, the `reduce` function needs to be imported from the `functools` module.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many more advanced functions, of any order, can be created by combining these three higher-order functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "A note from last year: usually, the `reduce` function is more difficult to grasp than `map` and `filter` but I found this blog-post by AndrÃ© Burgaud to be a nice introduction to `reduce`. Note that Burgaud talks about the more general _fold_ concept rather than `reduce`, which is a special case of fold often called _left fold_ (this is covered in more detail in the post). https://www.burgaud.com/foldl-foldr-python/"
