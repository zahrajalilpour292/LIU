# MSc Statistics and Machine Learning
## Linkoping University
Overview of my laboratory work for the master studies in Statistics and Machine Learning at Link√∂ing University 2020-2021.


### [Advanced Data Mining](https://github.com/zahrajalilpour292/LIU/tree/main/Advanced%20Academic%20Studies)

All labs are done with Weka V3.6.12.

During this course, Association analysis (Apriori principle, FP grow algorithm), Cluster analysis (partitional clustering methods, hierarchical cluster analysis, density-based cluster analysis) are being studied.
This course covers the following content:

* Partitioning_Methods : K-Means, K-Medoids, PAM, CLARA, CLARANS.

* [Hierarchical Methods](#Hierarchical_Methods) : AGNES, DIANA; BIRCH, ROCK, CHAMELEON.

* [Density-Based Methods](#Density_Based_Methods) : DBSCAN, OPTICS, Denclue.

* [Association Analysis](#Association_Analysis): Apriori algorithm, FP-grow Algorithm, Monotone/Antimonotone Constraints.
