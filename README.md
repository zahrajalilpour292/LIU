# MSc Statistics and Machine Learning
## Linkoping University
Overview of my laboratory work for the master studies in Statistics and Machine Learning at Linköing University 2020-2021.


### [Advanced Data Mining](https://github.com/zahrajalilpour292/LIU/tree/main/Advanced%20Data%20Mining)

All labs are done with Weka V3.6.12.

During this course, Association analysis (Apriori principle, FP grow algorithm), Cluster analysis (partitional clustering methods, hierarchical cluster analysis, density-based cluster analysis) are being studied.
This course covers the following content:

* Partitioning_Methods : K-Means, K-Medoids, PAM, CLARA, CLARANS.

* Hierarchical_Methods : AGNES, DIANA; BIRCH, ROCK, CHAMELEON.

* Density_Based_Methods : DBSCAN, OPTICS, Denclue.

* Association_Analysis: Apriori algorithm, FP-grow Algorithm, Monotone/Antimonotone Constraints.

### [Advanced Programming in R](https://github.com/zahrajalilpour292/LIU/tree/main/Advanced%20Programming%20in%20R)

The course is devoted to studying the programming language R, including its standard and more advanced tools. The course is a mix of lectures and exercise sessions. Such concepts as:
* Reading data from file and from the internet

* Data structures, functions and objects

* Debugging, object-oriented programming

* Performance enhancement

* Parallel programming and many other concepts

### [Bayesian Learning](https://github.com/zahrajalilpour292/LIU/tree/main/Bayesian%20Learning)

The course aims to give a solid introduction to the Bayesian approach to statistical inference, with a view towards applications in data mining and 
machine learning. 
The course covers the following topics:
*  Likelihood, Subjective probability, Bayes theorem, Prior and posterior distribution

*  Bayesian analysis of the following models: Bernoulli, Normal, Multinomial, Multivariate normal

*  Linear and nonlinear regression, Binary regression, Mixture models

*  Regularization priors, Classification, Naïve Bayes, Marginalization, Posterior approximation, Prediction, Decision theory,

*  Markov Chain Monte Carlo, Gibbs sampling

*  Bayesian variable selection, Model selection, Model averaging.
