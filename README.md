# MSc Statistics and Machine Learning
## Linkoping University
Overview of my laboratory work for the master studies in Statistics and Machine Learning at Link√∂ing University 2020-2021.


### [Advanced Data Mining](https://github.com/zahrajalilpour292/LIU/tree/main/Advanced%20Data%20Mining)

All labs are done with Weka V3.6.12.

During this course, Association analysis (Apriori principle, FP grow algorithm), Cluster analysis (partitional clustering methods, hierarchical cluster analysis, density-based cluster analysis) are being studied.
This course covers the following content:

* Partitioning_Methods : K-Means, K-Medoids, PAM, CLARA, CLARANS.

* Hierarchical_Methods : AGNES, DIANA; BIRCH, ROCK, CHAMELEON.

* Density_Based_Methods : DBSCAN, OPTICS, Denclue.

* Association_Analysis: Apriori algorithm, FP-grow Algorithm, Monotone/Antimonotone Constraints.

### [Advanced Programming in R](https://github.com/zahrajalilpour292/LIU/tree/main/Advanced%20Programming%20in%20R)

The course is devoted to studying the programming language R, including its standard and more advanced tools. The course is a mix of lectures and exercise sessions. Such concepts as:
* Reading data from file and from the internet
* Data structures, functions and objects
* Debugging, object-oriented programming
* Performance enhancement
* Parallel programming and many other concepts
