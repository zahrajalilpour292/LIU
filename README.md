The course is devoted to studying the programming language R, including its standard and more advanced tools. The course is a mix of lectures and exercise sessions. Such concepts as:
* Reading data from file and from the internet

* Data structures, functions and objects

* Debugging, object-oriented programming

* Performance enhancement

* Parallel programming and many other concepts

### [Bayesian Learning](https://github.com/zahrajalilpour292/LIU/tree/main/Bayesian%20Learning)

The course aims to give a solid introduction to the Bayesian approach to statistical inference, with a view towards applications in data mining and 
machine learning. 
The course covers the following topics:
