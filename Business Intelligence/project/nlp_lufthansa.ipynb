      "    I took a nearly full flight from London to Frankfurt today due to private emergency.   The seats including middle were nearly all full around me. I asked and challenged the stewards on duty why are they putting passengers safety at risk even just to make the middle seat free for sake of health of passengers and they said was outside their control. The ticket price was also exceptionally high for this experience. I hope this airline is not trying to profiteer out of the current situation now that virtually all competition is not flying. I am a Senator card holder and flown many times however this experience has started to changed my opinion about this airline and really hope profits are not put forward instead of safety passenger. Who is accountable for making such decisions as staff seem to shirk it off as not their fault.\n",

      "    Update: Lufthansa finally gave up trying to force or pretend vouchers was the only option available. Agreed to receive full refund and the transaction has been fully reverted now. Still giving 3/5 given the situation shouldnt have been this complicated.   Horrendous experience calling customer \"services\" today, amid all this corona virus madness my flights got cancelled and tried to see options to rebook. This was a holiday I booked almost a year in advance and was meant to be the highlight of our year.  This horrible lady who didnt say her name was awful, when I enquired about changing the flights to later in the year she said it would cost me £2.400 per customer (original flights were £1100 for two!). When I asked her why it was so much more expensive she said it was my fault for changing the flights!!   I confronted her saying that I could see in Lufthansa webpage the flights I asked for were quoted for £1200 both passenger so I couldnt understand why she was quoting such a difference, her answer was: \"if you dont like the option I gave you just book and paid whatever you want and loose your other flight\".  Honestly, Id appreciate someone from Lufthansa to come back to me and explain why can an employee be so rude and disrespectful, her job is to help customers to get the best out of this situation and not rip people off!  I must say when I called again later and a nice gentleman helped me and managed to changed the flights free of charge.. so probably the other employee was after some commission or a tap in then shoulder for sale records..  Anyway, will never book with this company again.\n",

      "    To whom it may concern, My fiance and I were due to travel from New Zealand to Copenhagen to get married on the 6th of June 2020. However, due to Covid-19 raging in the World, our flights by Emirates were cancelled by the airline and they were so kind to re-book our trip for later this year at no cost. In fact, everything was cancelled. Our wedding venue, the Church where we supposed to get married, our honeymoon. I think most people can imagine the sadness and disappointment my fiance and I felt. We were working hard for 2 years to be able to afford the wedding and we were looking forward to finally celebrate with our loved ones. On that note, my fiances mother was supposed to travel from Costa Rica to Crakow (where the wedding celebrations were originally going to be held) to see her son &#8211; whom she hasnt seen for 3 years &#8211; getting married. So we called Lufthansa hoping that they would re-book her flight. They wouldnt. They said that because it hasnt yet been cancelled, we need to pay another 900 Euros to change the dates to later this year. Same route, same time, same everything &#8211; but a different date. It is in my opinion so irresponsible, first of all, for Lufthansa not to suspend that flight when Emirates cancelled our flights on the same date. And second of all, to not be helpful in this time of crisis for everyone. It is incredibly disappointing to see how greedy some companies can be and taking advantage of this pandemic while the whole world has come together united spreading kindness and compassion. Obviously, we arent canceling our wedding, our trip, our honeymoon, my fiances mothers trip, by choice, but because we were forced by the current situation to do so. Be safe, be kind, safe lives.\n",

      "    First time booking with Lufthansa and was quite looking forward. Had a flight booked birmingham to paris via frankfurt which they took two weeks to take payment of, then I noticed by chance my flight had been cancelled and move to one two hours earlier without any communication. And despite offering a full refund due to covid19 Im still waiting for a refund they said would take 10 days its been two weeks. You wont last long after covid19 if you cant look after your customers.\n",

      "    I was told on March 10 that Lufthansa would refund my money for a cancelled flight. Today is April 2, over 3 weeks later, and I have still not received my money. When I called today, I was told to \"be patient.\" Tell me, why did United Airlines (despite whatever you might think of United) refund my money for the identical flight 2 days later?! How much time does it take to credit my credit card?! Why is Lufthansa intentionally hanging on to my money?\n",

      "    So I booked a return trip from Copenhagen to Greece with Lufthansa and there are 4 flights in total. 2 of my flights were canceled and I was not notified, I only found out later when I log in to check my bookings on their site. I eventually canceled the trip and asked for refund. After countless calls and emails to their non-existing customer support I have finally gave up, I never heard back from them. Please keep this in mind and never fly with Lufthansa again\n",

      "    We will never fly Lufthansa again! Very bad handling of the coronavirus crisis. Non existent customer support line. No options for online rebook. Their marketing of goodwill offer for flexible booking only works for their publicity and nothing else. Our flight is due on March 25, our booking ref is LL9YKR.  We tried calling UK and Germany call center but couldnt get through. Then we were recommended by the airline Facebook comment and their chatbot that due to the call volume, we should make use of their flexible option online. So we tried going ahead with the cancellation hoping to see rebook options in the next step.  No rebook possible online! We lost our flights and now it is as if we voluntarily cancel our booking without making use of their flexible options!  Please resolve this issue!  Lots of customers depends on your very poor management.  Im usually a big fan of the airline but I will not fly Lufthansa anymore!\n",

      "    Booked an early morning flight from TSR to LHR in January for Mar 22.  Yesterday I get an email from Lufthansa advising me of confirmation of a booking on 3/22 but a flight hours later.   No explanation in the email, so logging in and looking saw the earlier flight was not listed, so surmised they canceled that one and dumped everyone to the later - problem was, that time didnt work for the rest of the itinerary and online said it couldnt be changed or refunded(remember, Lufthansa cancelled the original flight and unilaterally rebooked on a much later flight...)  Well, three calls to their customer service (waiting 30 mins to over an hour before having to give up and hung up to do other things i needed to do), and an email un-responded to, this evening I finally reached a woman in C/S after another 30+ min wait on hold, and she was very arrogant and rude - when I suggested they put the option to change the booking online when Lufthansa does this, she insisted you could - I assured her you couldnt and offered a screen shot... but at least changed the booking to the day before to salvage the rest of the existing connecting travel (luckily could travel the day before)  Theres more, but gives the idea.  Hopefully the flying experience will not be as bad as the horrendous customer service treatment.  My first experience with Lufthansa and I travel a lot - likely my last unless they step up dramatically.   BTW other airlines like Delta have been great to deal with the crisis situation cause by COVID-19, so if Lufthansa doesnt have enough decently trained and empowered call center people, maybe its CEO and other execs need to jump in and take calls and help them.... ;)  Update Mar 17 -  They still direct you to call their service counter for most of their COVID-19 options vs handling online, which BTW Ive tried many times - results -0-  Rings, rings... disconnected w/o answering; few times it answers - on hold 20 - 45 mins+. Then it disconnects, so impossible to do anything with them...  Email attempts ... fruitless so far.  On the other hand, Delta Airlines - excellent and focused on its customers and communities.  Whats so challenging about this Lufthansa?  Why can others step up and you can not?  Update: 4/18 - Finally after a week of trying to call and email, connected with an agent and they arranged a full refund - so thanks to them... Will up my rating from 1-star to 3-star for finally taking care of this because they put me through hell and lots of effort and time on my part to reach this point, where Delta was in front of the curve and deserved their 5-stars.  Update 4/9/20 - Well, still no refund despite 23-days passing.  Recent email with their customer services:  On 4/7 \"The agent you spoke on the phone sent the ticket to the queue for refund. This is the right procedure. The refund is processed in the ticketing department, not by the customer service agent. Since the ticketing department has been overwhelmed with requests, your refund is still waiting processing. Unfortunately, we cannot provide you with a timeframe. We understand that this is frustrating and we sincerely apologize. Please keep monitoring your account. Your refund will be processed eventually. Best regars, Bilyana Borislavova Lufthansa German Airlines\"  Prior one on 4/6 - \"Thank you for your emails. Please accept our apologies for the late reply caused by high volume of requests received in the past month.  I have checked your request and I see you have already cancelled the booking. Your request for refund is noted and it will be fulfilled. Our service centers, however, are at present giving priority to necessary rebookings and the coordination of repatriation flights. We are also aware of the legal situation and refunds of course continue to remain possible. We kindly ask for your understanding that due to the current situation it is not possible to uphold the usual deadlines. Best regards, Adriana Cvetkovic Lufthansa German Airlines\"  They really make in challenging and complicated - many layers and people - making you call - to do all but vouchers, so it appears to me they are likely trying to avoid paying out cash at the moment, event willing to break the law in doing so?  Many were tested by this pandemic, and airlines like Delta stepped up and even went further and did more than asked, so they have my business for life  .... beware of this company dear future travelers!!!!  Update 4/23 -  Even though I was told by the Customer Rep on 4/18 my refund was submitted and to expect it within 3-10 days,  30+ days later - nothing!    In emails and a phone call, got the they dont know when, that dept is overwhelmed, no there is no way to contact them directly blah, blah, bah....  I agree with some others - they are doing everything to hold onto customers money to keep operating and they are breaking the law.\n",

      "    The worst airline Ive ever travelled with.   My friend (from Canada visiting me in CPH) and I was flying from Copenhagen to Malaga Oct 2019. Luggage did not arrive in Malaga, we were told it would arrive in the evening - fine, it happens, but... the luggage never arrived and no one reached out to us. When we reached out to lufthansa and airport no one could inform us where the luggage was or when it would arrive. One week later we flew back to Copenhagen (luggage never arrived). To make matters worse my friend flew back to Canada with no luggage. Luckily it showed up 3 weeks later. Told myself I would NEVER travel with Lufthansa again, because customer service (or lack thereof) was absolutely TERRIBLE. To make matters worse we paid about $140 extra for luggage and seat selection only to have them seat us seperately and no luggage to check-in.    2 months later - January 2020 - I booked a flight a return flight from Los Angeles to Copenhagen with United Airline (or thats what I thought). Turned out the flight back (10,5 hr long flight) was operated by Lufthansa. I was honestly really annoyed because I was not informed about this by my agency. However, I accepted it and made sure to check-in online early and a book seat (because theres no way Im sitting middle-seat on a 10-11 hr flight). Prior to boarding they ask me to come to the desk on the sepaker and they tell me they have to change my seat. The reason: Another person booked that seat too. Is this a joke? How can 2 people book the same seat. Hello... This is 2020. Anyways I tell them its fine as long as they assign me another aisle seat or at the very least a window seat. Then she has the audacity to say: Im sorry this is a fully booked flight, I can only assign you a middle seat. Im a pretty patient customer. Flying to and from North America a lot, I have encountered my fair share problems with airline. But this was the last straw. DO YOURSELF A FAVOUR AND STAY AWAY FROM LUFTHANSA!\n",

      "    I had flight from Toronto to Iran on January 23th 2020 and return from Iran to Toronto on February 5th 2020 .5 days before the flight Lufthansa sent me the e-mail and canceled all flight to Iran until April 01 2020. Please note I purchase this ticket 3, 4 month back I had surgery in Iran on February 02 2020. They asked me to call customer service for more assistance. I called them immediately and customer service rep told me all flight canceled for security reason , I asked for rebook ticket with other airline as all other flight such as Qatar , Emirate and Turkish airline still continuing flights to Iran , she told me unfortunately we cannot rebook and the only option they gave me is full refund , I told her I purchased this ticket long time ago and if I wanted to replace it with any other airline with such short time frame I have to pay 3,4 times more expensive on price and I cannot afford it anymore , she asked me to contact Lufthansa customer relation by e-mail . I have sent them e-mail and explained the situation on January 18 2019. They reply me back on January 20th that someone will contact me shortly and for any other question I can call Lufthansa. I was so frustrated and called and canceled my surgery in Iran. the day after I have called Lufthansa for follow up as after days I havent received any respond, this time the representative told me they can rebook me with any other airline , I was super upset as I already canceled my surgery and asked them how come no one offered me this option before and again no answer from the rep but \"I am sorry sir\" .  I told them to rebook me again and after 30 min waited on phone they dropped  call on me , I called them again and asked the for rebook, this time representative told me they can only book me same date ! I asked them it ok just please rebook me with any flight, again after 25 min waiting they dropped the call on me again honestly I could not believe my experience but I did not give up and I called them again and this time I asked if I can talk to supervisor or manager as reps keep dropping my call and the representative told me no I cannot connect you to manager! I was not able to believe this , I never had such disaster costumer service experience in my life , they were forcing me to cancel my flight without giving me any other option . Now after a week I have not received any call or e-mail form Lufthansa, I canceled my surgery in Iran, I didnt even received my refund for ticket. For the first time in my life I feel not only I have no right as passenger for them but also I have no human right they dont even bother to answer me. I need someone to please advise me how and where can I claim my rights as I feel super upset and do not know what to do .\n",

      "    On our flight from Frankfurt to Hong Kong in December, the food was poor, eg, dry sandwiches and the entertainment system was malfunctioning. Unfortunately, this fault meant that our two children could not get the games nor the movies working, making for a very long flight. We had this exact same issue 2 years ago and I thought that Lufthansa would have fixed it. On the positive side, the food, service and the entertainment system were much better on the Hong Kong to Munich return flight. So it seems its a bit of a mixed bag with Lufthansa. Their prices are keen but you may not get the service you expect from a large airline. Im particular, watch out for the flights out of Frankfurt to the Asian hubs Shanghai and Hong Kong.\n",

I tried to check-in online but could not see the seat that I have been allocated.   After very frastrating 30 minutest trying to check in online I decided to call for support.   The greeting was way too complicated and there were too many options to choose from. Then an operator from Manilla answered the phone. The line was really poor quality and I had no choice but to pot down the phone and try again.  The second attempt was a disaster too. After I was greeted by the foreign-speaking agent the line simply cut off so I gave up on trying to check-in online or to find out where am I seating.  Lufthansa, get your operations in order. You should have your support in Germany since you are a german carrier. Improve the quality of the telephone support and most importantly invest some money in improving the user experience on your website.

We had a problem at Budapest as our Visa to the USA had a typo error and we couldnt board, we manage to get the visa corrected within 2 hours but the gates had shut, we fully realise we are at fault here but the Lufthansa help desk at the airport wouldnt even consider we pay for another flight at our cost to be able to continue our once in a lifetime trip, I mean there is no more work for the airline as the bookings continued from LA six days later, the help desk said they would continue the trip for $9000 AU, if that is not calculating corporate greed to leave us stranded in a foreign country with limited funds with absolutely no compromise or kind judgement from them at all, we practically lost most of our US and NZ bookings for hotel car hire and transfers as well, not to mention getting home somehow. We feel that someone in your management system requires a humanity adjustment as that was one low down grubby money grabbing act.without any compassion at all, we still cannot get are heads around why this unreasonable decision was made against us other than sheer greed and because you could, I would love to meet the coward man who made all the decisions sitting behind a phone line. I see looking at the www that Lufthansa do not rate to well, well I can assure you I will do my utmost to help your ratings drag along.

Their delayed flight from Oslo left me with 20 mins at Munich to catch my flight to Singapore. I ran to the gate mentioned on the app to find the gate had been changed. Literally ran to the flip side of the airport (because German airports are pure excrement). I was the last person to arrive only 5 mins before flight time. But since this flight was also Lufthansa, it was ofcourse late too.  Arrived in Singapore to find out that our luggage never made it. There was NOT a single person from Lufthansa to offer an explanation or apology. They had outsourced a third party company to offer us shut-up petty cash.   I refused your cash Lufthansa. Keep it. You need it more to feed your ghastly team.   P.S. Thank you for the notification I received a day later for the change of gate. So helpful!  What great reflection of Germany!\n",

I had to call again hoping that I would get a better customer service representative. The second time was connected to an Indian accent guy who was clearly eating something while talking to me. He asked me whethere he can put me on hold to investigate, and I was on hold for 20 minutes. I got frustrated and hung up the phone and dialed again. Finally the third time I get connected to a helpful lady that looked up my file and answered in less than 3 minutes.  I would never book with Lufthansa again because of this kind of service they provide to the customers. I hope Lufthansa management would take care of better serving their customers by reviewing their customer service representatives performance.\n",

      "    Terrible customer service at the ticket counter at Ohare airport.  Lady was snippy from the moment I walked up to the counter.  I was putting my suitcase on the scale and she wanted my passport and I felt like I was being rushed but there was no lines.  Once I gave her my passport, she said in an unfriendly manner \"your passport is not signed.\"  I explained that it was a new passport and I would be happy to sign it. She then got me checked in and said do you have a carry-on. I said yes and I showed her my carry-on she said well it has to fit in the container over there. I said ok but much to my surprise it did not fit. Been using the same carry-on for 10 years never had a problem with it before. It was very evident looking at the container that it was sized differently than what Ive typically seen in the past, width was skinnier.   I told her Id never had any issues before and she said something about the sizes have recently changed but then she said something like Lufthansa always enforces the size limitations.  She suggested that I check the bag which I could not do because it had my computer and some other items I needed on the flight. I tried a couple different times and ways to fit the bag in the container but it was about 1/2 inch too big at the wheels.  I ended up having to repack my suitcases and I threw away my carry-on because there was no reason to check it and everything could fit in my regular bag that I was checking. The real kicker was when I was going through the gate area and boarding the plane there was another container to check your size bags and it was the kind that I had seen in the past in my bag would have easily fit in that one. In addition they were people with much larger bags taking them on the plane is carry-ons. I am extremely perplexed at what the problem was and why there are two different sizes containers for people to test their bags ..  a much smaller size at the ticket counter and a regular size at the gate. Is it just a ploy to get people to check more bags?  The idea that my bag was too large in and of its self is understandable because of the various regulations. However the part that is not understandable and absolutely not acceptable with her attitude and tone that she took with me from the moment I walked up to the ticket counter. The other unacceptable aspect of the situation is having two different size containers for people to check their bags.   Thank goodness my checked bag made it to my destination otherwise I wouldve had no spare clothing do use until it arrives.\n",

      "    Ill make this as short as possible. During my vacation a major natural disaster occurred near my home, resulting in over 200,000 people being evacuated and over 1 million without power. My entire home County was in a mandatory evacuation zone experiencing a massive fire, as such returning on my scheduled flight was not a option. This was international news and of course able to be verified. The first call I got hung up on after holding for a half hour then the second call took an entire hour. The best Lufthansa was willing to do was allow be to change the date of my flight, but I had to pay a significant up charge (hundreds) and they were not willing to work with me to change the departure airport which cost me hundreds more in accommodations. As someone in customer service I understand the purpose of policy, but when massive natural disasters and evacuations occur, one would hope a good business would provide some more leeway. To be clear the flight quality itself has not been an issue, but I would give their customer service a solid 1 star and will never fly with them again.\n",

      "    We havent flown yet and I am regretting it already. We booked return tickets for the family including our 1 year old for next year and werent sure if we would get bassinet seats so I went online to their site. After much search the system response was basically booking through a third party company should be dealt with by them . I then specifically wrote to them requesting reservation for those seats and after days of waiting, below are the answer:  \"It will be against a fee of EUR 35,00 (€) per seat per flight to reserve in advance.  As seating cannot be reserved via email, in order for you to reserve your seats in advance for either of these flights you can contact our Colleagues in the Reservations Department as the seats are chargeable to reserve in advance.   You will be able to locate the number on the website; www.lufthansa> Customer services > Help & Contact > Lufthansa Service Center/Flight bookings and service enquiries  Alternatively you will be able to reserve your seating on the Lufthansa website via the following process,  www.lufthansa> My Bookings > Flight details > Seat Reservations > Add/change seats  Please note, however, that you will not be able to reserve the Bassinet Seating online.\"  So here go, back to step one !

      "    I have never had such bad customer service. To book and pay them, there are every option possible and theyll make sure they are reachable and responsive within the minute. But once you have a problem with your flight (eg. they made a cancellation and they have to refund you). There is no hotline for you to call. Only e-mails and they will answer you once every 3 weeks. Good luck when there is something that they get wrong and you have to explain again. They are not the smartest of the bunches neither. Its now been 4 months, and we havent seen our money back.  So brace yourself if there is a problem with your flight and they owe you money. You probably wont get it back. Like we didnt.\n",

      "    My luggage has gone missing from a Eurowings flight on Sunday and is yet to be found.  I checked it in in Zagreb and had a layover in Cologne, and no one can tell me in which city the suitcase is or when its going to be flown to Lisbon.  The Eurowings tracer is useless, it doesnt give me any updates and theyre not picking up the phone. I am literally waiting at the moment for my call to be answered and have been on hold for more than 30 minutes twice today. Their social media agents are just as useless, they simply redirect customers to an email address that apparently no one is checking.  So far, the only reply I got was an automated macro:  \"Dear Ladies and Gentlemen,  Thank you for your request registered under the following Ticket ID:420736  Resolving your request and answering questions are a top priority for us. A member of our support team will follow up with you in a timely matter to resolve your inquiry.  Currently the processing may take up to 4 weeks, therefore we kindly ask you to refrain from further status inquiries.  You can track the status of your delayed baggage under (link).  If you would like to submit additional documents or information on an existing inquiry, we kindly ask you to use the reply function of your email program. Please submit copies of your documents as email attachments.  Thank you for your understanding.\"  The process cannot take 4 weeks, it cannot even take 4 days as I need my luggage back as soon as possible, for obvious reasons. I had the same problem on the way there but was dealing with a far more competent airline who was able to deliver my bag ON THE SAME DAY. Eurowings hadnt even put in the information on the tracker that I had taken a flight from Zagreb to Cologne and were only trying to trace my luggage back to the flight from Cologne to Lisbon.  In the meantime, Im trying yet again to get connected to a support agent on the German line, after trying the Portuguese one, but none of your lines seem to be working.  I tried contacting you on Facebook as well, but the reply I got was the following:  \"Dear Raquel, Im sorry to hear about your delayed baggage. According to international regulations, the last operating airline is responsible. Please keep in touch with Eurowings or the telephone number on your loss report - they are the right point of contact. Apologies for any inconvenience caused - I hope you will be reunited with your bags soon! /John\"  I will keep sending you \"further status inquiries\" on all channels available, including Lufthansas, until I get a concrete answer on where my bag is and when it will be delivered.  As Eurowings parent company you really should be more concerned about their customers.\n",

No way of resetting the PIN, not via the link on the email, not on the website. Tried the phone, after a long wait I was told they could only resend my PIN BY POST! And then they disconnected me.

      "    I went to Europe for honeymoon of 15 days euro trip.I landed Paris on 28/09/2019 by Lufthansa LH1040 from Frankfurt to CDG.My checked in baggage didnt arrived at CDG airport. For bag claim, I filled the form at airport for baggage claim with Lufthansa & got a receipt with file reference number.They said the reference number can be used to check the status of baggage online. The status was blank untill 29/01/2019. On 30/09/2019,the status changed directly to delivery in progress. There was no status in between,like bag is located at Frankfurt airport or bag arrived at CDG airport. I kept waiting for the baggage whole day no one called nor the bag was delivered. I was in Paris untill 01/10/2019 till 5:00 am(1st Oct).It was promised that I will get my bag before 01/10/2019, which never happened. While leaving Paris from CDG airport to Zurich, I went to Lufthansa baggage claim counter and provided them with my new address for next three days(04/10/2019)i.e; Luzern. I was again promised that my bag will be sent to Zurich with next flight on 01/10/2019, which again didnt happened. I kept calling customer care baggage claim department and everyone promised that it will arrive Zurich within given time frame. I assume, that the guy whom I spoke to while leaving CDG airport, updated my address but didnt cancelled my delivery in Paris. On 3/10/2019(3rd Oct),I got call from a delivery guy in Paris and he wanted to deliver the bag to me in Paris. So fact is, Lufthansa didnt even inform the delivery department about the address change for 3 working days. Hence,the delivery person didnt retuned my bag to Lufthansa at CDG airpor. Lufthansa should have cancelled the delivery on same day 01/10/2019 at 8:00 am(when I visited them). I kept calling them and Lufthansa kept telling me that bag will arrive in Zurich before 4th October.Todays is 3rd October and bag is still in Paris and with courier/delivery department(not at Paris airport). Hence I am still in Europe with 1 jacket,a sandal,a t-shirt and a purse. No toothpaste, shampoo,long coat & my DSLR.Like a beggar,I travelled Europe. All you can do is keep calling the and they will say delivery in progress but they dont even know that delivery is scheduled for which address.They say bag is located but they dont know the airport or city name. There is no way that you can escalate it. there is nothing called as priority,not for free nor for a price which I was ready to pay for there mistake. It was my honeymoon trip in Europe.I was supposed to be in Paris for 15 days because no one does that. I came to visit multiple countries and cities in Europe. Worst part, I had to water same jeans and t-shirt for 5 days. My boots were inside the checked in bag and thus I had to visit to the cold places in sandals and my husbands shoes.  Lufthansa doesnt care for what you are going its shame in the name of customer service.\n",

      "    Marseille to Hong Kong via Munich. Non existent service from Lufthansa. Completely inflexible procedure as the airline would not allow us to Fly from Marseille to Munich (the first leg of the flight we had booked) to find an alternative route following the shut down of Hong Kong Airport due to the protest. We were supposed to fly to Phuket the next day from Hong Kong so wanted to fly to Munich to find a way to from there to fly either to Phuket or to Bangkok, so we would not miss out on our holidays. The chef dEscale in Marseille told us that we could not board our flight even just to Munich and that she could not offer any other alternative solution. Lufthansa made us miss our flight letting us stranded in Marseille. We had no other option than to cancel our flight and book a last minute flight with another airline since that was not an option from Lufthansa. As a result we had to stay in Marseille for another 24 hours, rent a new car for the 24hours and arrange to stay another night for the 5 of us in Marseille.\n",

He had 2 checked in bags but they only have one suitcase of his and just hang up the phone as they cant be bothered to do their jobs. They say there customer care department is not containable by phone (hello this is the 21st century) so we are only able to email a complaint through Lufthanss website, I have submitted feedback via their website and it asks me for my back details, WHY do they ask me that????   Unless you can locate our lost bags (which we find worrying in an airport) which we think is appalling considering you operate in an airport, which is considered heightened security.   We fly every other month so consider us a valuable customer considering long distance flights are circa £1,000 but unless this terrible experience with Lufthansa is satisfactorily resolved will only fly with your competitors British Airways or Iberia, who cannot do enough for their customers and create a fun, stress free experience, I suggest the senior managers of Lufthansa look into their competitors on how to run an airline company.  We await for feedback.  @Lufthansa_DE @Airport_FRA  DO NOT FLY WITH LUFTHANSA, TERRIBLE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE WITH LUFTHANSA.\n",

      "    I am a frequent flayer and I take Lufthansa occasionally both for short and long distance. I never had problems, but my recently my flight was delayed and I missed a connection during a family emergency. The staff at the airport was very kind and I had no problem to receive a decent hotel, and re-arranging immediately the flight for the next day. Unfortunately, the missed connection implied losing a car rent and other troubles. The customer service agreed immediately a compensation without involving lawyers or mediators. Well, to be honest I agree also with other reviews: it took quite some time to receive a confirm and a feedback after the first email. At one point, I also thought they disappeared...But the money arrived when they said (and my bank did not communicate it). Even when I was annoyed they were very professional. I understand the complaints by other passengers, but between all the troubles I had in my flights around the world Lufthansa has been the one of the few companies that really took responsibility when there were problems. And for me this is a fully deserved 5 star!\n",

We then headed back into Birmingham airport were the one Lufthansa representative who was obviously sick of the matter told everyone she was going for more staff and did a runner lol &#128514;yes never to be seen again ....( funny but discussing it was very late early hours and my 8 year old had suffered enough by now ... so luckily a policeman was pointing people in the direction of phones to call Lufthansa ... people queued for hours so I used my mobile through the stress  of waiting when through they eventually booked me on a flight for the 27th even though I asked if there were other airports or airlines there and answer was you can have a refund .... great ? So there I am 1am in the morning stuck in the airport now a very long day ... we headed home didnt even get there when received another txt message cancelling that flight ? Yes I think we we told almost anything to get us of the phones and out there hair .... I spent most of the night calling Lufthansa in the end I had to settle for flights 61 hours later almost half my holiday ... now has anybody tried to call customer services about problem compensation etc etc ... dont bother your given an e mail .... has any body tried to e mail ... well wouldnt bother almost impossible to get and when you do get it takes forever to come back to you over a weak just to say .... yes you guessed it sorry but your getting nothing ? Weather was bad ? Lol lol it was a storm for a few hours ! Night at the most  ... NOT 61 hours you didnt even try to get people to there destination quickly and affectively...and to top it all call customer services impossible .... Disgusting disgusting for a big modern company to try every trick in the book NOT to pay compensation and take responsibility ... Lufthansa e nailed quoting etc 261/2004 please note Lufthansa NO phone calls were supplied by your staff ... no travel expenses ..... no accommodation.... in fact you should read it again yourself but I will spell it out for you .... help and look after your customers &#128077;&#127997; Properly .. its all about the money for Lufthansa they dont care about write or wrong ..... you have a duty of care to your customers which you failed miserably..........your taking the extra 261 and bending it to please yourself ........................see you in court ?                            5/9/19 had a email quoting no compensation cancelled due to bad weather (for 61 hours)what?

      "    was told 2 flights on the same day were cancelled but when I went onto the lufthansa website I could see one flight still there and the other flight had been changed to 5 minutes earlier but the alternatives they gave me were hours later. They couldnt care less about their customers. I actually had the flights changed back by one of the customer service representatives only then to be changed back again and be told that he had no authority to do that by another customer service representative. Terrible customer service representatives on the phone do nothing but hang up on you no help whatsoever am trying to figure out why I was told my flight was cancelled when I can still see it on their website was told I cant speak to a manager. Book with an airline with a bit of courtesy and honesty and stay away from this lot if you want an easy and stress free flight.\n",

      "    The trip itself went well, but I was overcharged for a second piece of luggage. The employees at the airport admitted they were overcharging me compared to the information I was given during booking (Id printed it) but said they could do nothing about it, that their system was set, that I should get in touch later with their customer service to get my money back.  I did as they said, using Lufthansas dedicated page, attached copies of all the proofs, and ... no answer. (Even in my junk mailbox; I did check.) Now I wonder if that discrepancy between the price given at booking and the much higher price at the airport really was a mistake, or if it was a trap. More importantly, I realize that if any other problem or accident had occurred, Lufthansas customer service would have answered in very much the same way &#8212; by ignoring me entirely.\n",

      "    My mom was travelling on the Vancouver-Frankfurt flight on a long-haul journey with a connection at Frankfurt. The norm would have been a catering service comprising of a main meal and a snack meal (i.e. sandwiches), however it was to her surprise that the crew only served the passengers once. Consider the mere 10 hour journey, its odd to have a catering service of such sort.  Furthermore, the Lufthansa online check-in service was offline and we were not able to check-in mom and choose her desired seat, turning up to the airport and she was allocated with an awkward toilet view for 10 hours, one might find it pleasing but not in our camp. Very much a below par service from the German National carrier. Perhaps our last time with Lufthansa.\n",

      "    I didnt know that vegetarian meals were classes as special meals, as every onboard option has meat in it. On the way out, that was my mistake. On the way back to the UK, I made sure to email them, and got a confirmation that my special meal had been ordered.  However, on the flight, they had no record of this. I just ate bread. I complained to their customer service, who were COMPLETELY obtuse and told me that I had to order a special meal (even though I told them that I had). When I forwarded them emails as proof, they stopped responding to me. Appalling customer service. Will be doing my best to avoid them in the future.\n",

      "    Higher fares are charged by Lufthansa compared to budget airline EuroWings. But then they change your planes from bigger plane to smaller plane with no explanation given. Seat that I had booked got changed to a seat right next to the toilet although seat number was the same because plane was changed to smaller one. Airlines should give partial refund if they change the planes at last minute. Plus there was a lot of turbulence on the flight. This may be due to bad weather not airline fault. Sandwich and a drink offered on the plane. Cabin crew was friendly and prompt in service. Website is bad and check in process is not very user friendly. Not a very pleasant experience.\n",

      "    I was pleased with Lufthansa and a fan of the airline. But recently we had the worst check-in experience ever.  I booked a round flight by searching based on the origin and the destination indicating my nationality and followed the popped out search results assuming the results were accurate.  I booked a two-hub trip, and evidently, I should have had a Visa for less than two hours layover in a transit flight.  Because of that, I was not allowed to fly and forced to pay three times more for my wife and me to fly the next day. At the same time, there were two more people with the same problem and the staff, and the manager seemed totally familiar with the problem.  It seemed unusual and inferred that Lufthansa knew about the issue and did not prevent it from happening probably for a long time. It bothered me a lot, and I would say Lufthansa might do it intentionally because they offered no solution other than paying more, and such similar cases happen a lot, and many accept the offers like us. Because they dont have any other choices.  I feel it likes taking advantage of the most vulnerable people in their extremely desperate condition and unfair. At least they should let you be refunded. PS: all the personnel and the manager whom I dealt with were polite, helpful, and courteous.  However, when I was standing close to the stand and was extremely exhausted, desperate, and disappointed. One of Lufthansas staff approached and talked to the gentleman who helped me, and I overheard them and thought they were talking about my situation and tried to correct them. Suddenly, she turned to me and aggressively attacked me saying I was not talking to you. I was stunned and tried to explain that I mistakingly overheard them, but she kept coming more aggressively. Considering the situation and the strength of the reaction for such an innocent mistake, It was kind of weird situation, and I was sure when she turned and saw a white man, undoubtedly she would just have ignored it.\n",

      "    Lufthansa does not provide written customer support, so you have to phone a paid number. Not only it that an annoyance, its also a disadvantage for people with special accessibility needs.  Furthermore booking though Lufthansa is usually more expensive than with other airlines, and often less services are offered to passengers booked with Lufthansa. As an example: I booked a flight via Lufthansa that is operated by Singepore Airways (SQ). SQ wont let me reserve seats because I have a LH flight number, and LH wont let me reserve seats because the flight is operated by SQ.\n",

      "    Very bad behavior by Lufthansa by booking an overseas flight! .... Before I booked a ticket on-line for my gf that there was a problem as only the title Mrs (which was a mandatory field) could be choose, even she is a Ms! .... they told me twice when I called them about the problem, that it could easily be changed if I called them after the booking had been made ... but when I called them, they told me that it was not possible!!! .. how stupid are you allowed to be!!! Lufthansa told on phone that they would make an internal notice if something should go wrong in the airports she would pass - I asked for an confirmation on Email, but they refused to give me .... so if something should go wrong, they probably dont remember or never said!!!  More stupidiness! I even booked a flight-ticket online and got a booking number and was told I  could pay either on the phone or on Lufthansa homepage. I chose Lufthansa homepage, only realizing that it was mission impossible! ... I called them and told them about the problem,  and they asked me to wait 2 hours, as they needed to do some updating ... When I returned they had meanwhile cancelled the booking  without any notice!!! .... They told me they were sorry, but they couldnt do anything about it, even I had to choose another flight even it was a far more impropriate flight ....   I wrote the company 2-3 weeks ago, about both issues, customer.relations @ lufthansa.com , and just get weird/incompetent replies leading nowhere, just saying that some other department shall take care of my complain, but nothing happens .... Update: 13/10- 2018 - this time a very service minded girl at Lufthansa corrected the title of the ticket from Mrs to Ms .. But no response on  the cancel of my booking made by phone with Lufthansa! .. I did get another ticket on-line but it costed my gf 3 hours extra in transit in Frankfurt!  Lufthansa administration, you need to do some improvements on service and bea little more willing to find solutions when you make a failure, and not just say \"we sorry\", but we cant help you .. thats just an immature and not worthy way of responding! ..\n",

      "    I just had a brilliant exchange with Lufthansa on TW. They told me - Im not kidding - that due to EU GDPR they are unable to offer excellent customer service any more, both on board and in areas such as after services/customer relations. They have also disabled the functionality of a private message on Facebook and they fail to say why (I assume that because their social media managers were in fact human e-mails who were not replying to complaints on FB in substance but simply providing a customer care e-mail address).  Having said that, I have flown with them for years and have had nothing but excellent service on board.  I simply cannot understand how their customer care on board can be excellent and so unprofessional for after services, such as customer relations and above all their social media people.  It is insulting.\n",

      "    An absolute shambles of an airline First time and never ever again. Their staff (LHR TERMINAL 2 ) are clueless, arrogant and  they lack empathy . Couldnt believe a German company could be so lackadaisical when it comes to customer service. Our flight(24 Aug) was delayed then was eventually cancelled; we had to collect our checked in baggage from arrivals. Staff were very brusque in their manner - we had  our nephews  pre-wedding reception to attend that evening but we were told everyones got a wedding. could go on - but no space to write it all.  We were 8 in our party and none of us will ever travel Lufthansa again including the kids and young folks who were with us.  Flights are delayed or cancelled all the time but its how you deal with the aftermath of it all.My advice to Lufthansa is to treat customers with dignity and respect . You need to treat customers  as people and not as money tokens or numbers! Staff need to be well trained, I havent got a glass ball but if things dont change your annual turnover will sooner or later and it wont be in the right direction !\n",

      "    I really hope I m not forced to fly again this airline.  Flight delayed 1 hour and 30 minutes from Heatrow, lost my connection in Frankfurt since it was only 50 minutes, the minimum that the German law allows, but of course you have to change terminals and pass security check again , so even a 10 minutes delay will make you run.  Called support, they said the can put me on a direct flight , then changed their mind since i already check-in my baggage ...although the plane wasnt even there. So long story short, I had to stay 5 hours in Frankfurt. Used the time to research if I am entitled to compensation.  So I made a request, got rejected because \" a third party contractor made a fault on the aircraft on the previous flight\" Of course I didnt buy it, under EU law, they should have another plane ready if this happen...maintenance of planes is not an excuse. Hired a company to recover the compensation, they took them to court and yes, I got my compensation.  The staff nevertheless, are professional and they offer a nice customer experience on board.

      "    My first impression of Lufthansa was one of a giant in the commercial aviation industry. A firm that in no way compares to the likes of Wizzair and Ryanair. A company, that not only cares about their customers, but aim at achieving high quality customer service for EVERY customer. My goodness, was I wrong! My experience with Lufthansa started on February 5th with my connecting flight from Lviv to London Heathrow. Onboard the cabin crew and the seats were to a more than satisfactory level. However, that is where it stopped. The food provided was less than pleasing with a choice of a cheese sandwich or a beef sandwich, followed up by a cheap little candy bar. Then again, what can you expect from airlines nowadays? A fairly average experience so far, that is until we landed. Once I went through security and border control, my baggage was nowhere to be seen. After searching the airport proximity/waiting for 45 minutes I approached one of the lost baggage Lufthansa staff. A lady which instructed me to go on another circle of the airport before I fill in the lost baggage form. Which I did consequently, finding nothing (surprise-surprise). Once I started filling in the form I stated to her, that I have pictures of the baggage, surely this would aid the people in its search? To which I received a reply of: \"Its not important right now.\" So I went home disappointed with all my essentials in my bag. Next day I had work, which I couldnt attend as my shirts, blazer and overcoat were all in my bag. After work I contacted Lufthansa to ask if they had any update and to state the importance of the situation. No progress had been made, the lady I spoke with asked me if I had any pictures of the bag. Which I sent to her the same evening. Basically understanding, that if I had not made the effort, the company would not have either. Long story short... After 3 days I receive a call from somebody in Germany telling me exactly what was in my bag (They opened it, without permission). Although this is a basic breach of privacy, I didnt care at the time, as I just wanted my bag back. The company they work with Citybagsluggage are an even bigger joy to interact with than Lufthansa. They do not change delivery times or address and give you a delivery time only 30 minutes before the actual delivery takes place (2 hour window as they put it). To top things off, on one day they forgot that my baggage needs to be delivered and on the other they \"could not find the address\" - hilarious. It took them 3 days to deliver my baggage, which arrived dirty and scratched. (Pictures attached) Topping off an already amazing customer experience. For me, once a customer has already been put through a terrible customer experience, which the firm is fully responsible for, no expense should be spared to compensate the customer. Not with Lufhtansa apparently. I have contacted them 6 days ago to share my experience and still I have not received a reply! An absolute joke of a company!\n",

      "    My wife and I flew from London Heathrow to Bangkok, via Frankfurt on the 13th December 2017.&#160; We booked specific seats on the Frankfurt to Bangkok flight (LH772).&#160; When we booked the seats (76H and 76J) it was clear from the diagram of the plan layout that the seats we booked were exit seats with extra leg room.&#160; However, the actual seats had no extra leg room at all.&#160; We feel we were mis-sold these seats.&#160; Had normal seats been suitable for both of us then we would not have paid extra for specific ones.  &#160;  I am 63\" tall and have type 1 diabetes.&#160; I also have Klinefelters syndrome which means that my legs are extra long in proportion to my height.&#160; I struggle to physically fit in standard seats.&#160; I also have pain in my knees related to Klinefelters syndrome and the loss of bone density it causes.  &#160;  I spoke to a steward immediately on boarding but was informed there was nothing he could do as the flight was fully booked.&#160; He did acknowledge that customers regularly complain about these seats not being the same as the online seating plan.&#160; He indicated hed give us vouchers as compensation but they never appeared.  &#160;  When the passenger in front of me reclined his seat I was stuck in mine.&#160; I could not move as my knees were jammed against the seat in front.&#160; After an exchange with both the other passenger and the steward, the purser offered me a crew seat at the back of the plane which I was happy to accept as they had more leg room.&#160; However, as it had no arm rests and are not designed for comfort, it was not possible for me to sleep in it.&#160; I had to lie down on the floor and a stewardess kindly gave me extra blankets.&#160; My wife had to remain in the standard, mid-row seat.  &#160;  I have booked similar seats for the return flight on the 9th January (LH773, 76B and 76C) and as you can see from the attached screenshot taken from your website, it appears as if I have again booked seats with extra leg room.&#160; Will I get the extra leg room indicated on the seating plan or will the actual seats by laid out as they were on the outward flight?  &#160;  I cannot endure a long haul flight in which I cannot move in my seat.&#160; Please can you arrange for us to have seats on our return flight which meet my expectations and requirements, and for which we have paid.   I booked seats for my wife and I well in advance and paid a premium for seats that I understood would meet my requirements.&#160; In mis-selling these seats as having extra room Lufthansa has fallen well below my expectations of a 5-star airline.  Sent this email complaint on 28 Dec 2017 so far not had any response. Feedback ID 31516019.\n",

      "    Traveled with Lufthansa and they smashed my childs car seat.  They only offered a fraction of the value of the seat as it \"depreciates\" in value over time.  Lufhansa child seats are used for a fixed period of time i.e. 2-3 years at which point they have zero resale value as purchasing seats second hand is unsafe.  They are not like normal luggage should not be treated as such.  I dont see why I should be left out of pocket because you were careless.Terrible customer service.\n",

      "    Good afternoon,  On 12/09/2016 booked a two-way ticket trip to Riga (with a layover in Frankfurt) from lisbon for the weekend 25 to 27 of November of the same year. Check my flights details on the attached file.  The reason for this weekend was to celebrate the birthday of one of my best friends and to attend a Wine tasting event in Riga (this last one wasnt cheap at all and was kinda unique). The wine tasting event was already reembursed but the opportunity is lost, the birthday of my friend is kinda priceless.  Lufthansa already reembursed through edreams the value paid for the flight, just waiting for the reembursement for the luggage add-on. This issue is getting sorted out.  What I find strange, is after 5 months still havent received any news about my compensation fee for my cancelled flight, not only I went to the airport on the day in question at 4:30am, stayed over there waiting until a solution was sorted out (any was found), on the same day went 2 more times to the airport to complain again at the lufthansa counter, and the assistant stated (at the 2nd time) that my complaint was officially issued.  Already called loads of times to lufthansa numbers with no success, and the first 5minutes are is deutsch until the same message is reported in english, which makes it impossible for you to hang up the phonecall until they switch to english (to actually understand what is the message), therefore you end up paying huges phone fees.  So basically Im complaying through this service, to see if I get a faster reply from lufthansa, I got my weekend ruined so Im only demanding which is rightfully mine.

      "    I chose Luftansa because its a german company and I thought...It might be good. First of all the seats of the plane are tiny, similar to easy jet, considering I spend over 12 hours there it was a nightmare flying with them.  Food was disgusting, truly disgusting. Cabin crew did a great job, they offered drinks during the whole flight so nothing to say about them other than Thanks  My flight was cancelled because of technical issues, I put a complaint and they replied saying that according to the european bla bla bla I was not supposed to get a compensation because it was a technical issue. That european law says that if the flight is cancelled because of a companyissue, then I have to get a compensation... So I replied telling them about that so they decided to pay me. But their first answer was..Sorry!   Honestly, I would never fly with them again, but mainly because of the size of their flights\n",

I was meant to be flying Premium Economy, as a special treat, but ended up having to fly economy. I was promised a refund in the difference and compensation. So I email Lufthansa Customer relations and get given an ID number, but that is it. Now over 6 weeks later I have heard NOTHING, just the odd pathetic response on Facebook from them, telling me to keep waiting, its unbelievable that they cant get these things sorted, basically they are stealing my money, if I owed them money they would be very quick to collect!!!!!

      "    So it has been one of those situations with this so called reputable airline that has really frustrated me and disappointed me substantially.  To start off with I work in the travel industry and deal regularly with high profile customers and have dealt with many airlines in the past who have been more than helpful on many occasions.   So about a week ago, following the Istanbul attacks, I contacted them to query whether there was a waiver policy in place to which I was just given a \"no\", and it was left at that.    I left it at this, and then after discussion with friends we decided we were going to extend our stay in Turkey for an extra day, so today I accidentally rebooked a different flight which then caused my initial confirmed flight to be married up &#8211; Lufthansa employs this \"married segment control\" which is a pain in the rear end both to us travel agents, and travellers.    Thinking that they would help out a colleague, I approached them and explained my situation, but was just responded to with a \"no\".    To start with, they dont offer any special rates to agents, so for me to travel in a combination of premium economy and business class it already set me back over $4100.  On top of this, I would be paying them $270 in change fees which Im more than happy to do, but they just refuse to assist.   It annoys me, because this was not the only airline option available to me for the country I am visiting, and they just dont seem to be of any use to anyone (whether youre in the industry or not).    This is not the first, but it is definitely going to be last, that I fly with them, and I will certainly referring my clients to alternate carriers in the future!\n",

      "    Although I havent had reason to fly with Lufthansa for some years now, I still remember the good service that they were known for.  Last October, I had serious problems with Austrian and one of their agents in Vienna, as I changed flights to return to London from Sofia, even recommended that I fly with \"Easyjet\" lol  The 2nd leg of my flight was as bad as the 1st.  The so called meal, which then became a snack, which then became a fun size chocolate bar was less than the small cake that I got between Sofia and Vienna.  I complained to Austrians Head Office and was refused any compensation for the more serious problems of having to pay for luggage at check in when it was included in the ticket that I had been overcharged for, amongst other issues.  So, I cut my losses and forgot about it.  just over six months later and I received an email from Lufthansa (who now own Austrian Airlines) Customer Services and they offered me £223 compensation.  What a surprise that was!  Anyway, it appears that when Lufthansa took over Austrian, they identified a number of problems with Austrians Customer Service and that their actions, including lack of, were damaging and therefore Lufthansa decided to review Austrians complaints.  My complaint eventually came up and although Austrian had decided not to compensate, Lufthansa decided that I should have been compensated.  That is what I remember about Lufthansa, reliable flight, good inflight service and good customer service.  Lufthansa could have just ignored my original complaint and I would not have been bothered as the shole experience was long forgotten.\n",

      "    While flying back to South Africa from Amsterdam through to Frankfurt and then SA. They announced and asked that if anyone does not need to urgently get to Frankfurt they offer their seats up as the plane is overbooked. Since my wife and I had a 10 hour lay over in Frankfurt we happily put our hands up. We found out that per ticket they will give us 250 euros, I asked if I could get it transfered into my account, they said I could do so in South Africa at the Lufthansa office   Upon landing I immediately went to the office, I gave all my details and was out of there in 20 minutes. That was almost three weeks ago and after numerous emails, I still do not know when that money will be giving to me.

Late arrivals led to frantic running through the entire Frankfurt Airport.... 5 kilometers... more late arrivals meant overnight stay in Frankfurt airport, no staff available for guidance or support, ignorance EVERYWHERE.  They do have a website where you can write a detailed report over what happened, and they say they really want your feedback... but after 2 months and several reminders, I am now here on Trustpilot and all other social medias to warn you good people out there to stay far far far far away from that company.  I have also written directly to their Management, which is first name and a dot, and last name then @dlh.de. so f.i. their CEO´s email is  Christoph.Franz@dlh.de  Good luck  Leslie Cameron  I have absolutely no illusions that this will work, but I have to try.\n",

      "    My boyfriend and I booked an evening flight from Amsterdam to Berlin(direct) with Lufthansa, departing around 21:00. This was deliberate so we could enjoy a final day in Amsterdam before departing to our next stop.   Now we have been switched to a flight which departs at 13:45 and includes a 50 minute stopover in Frankfurt, effectively taking an entire day off our trip as we cant use the day for anything when we depart so early. It would have been ok  had the flight time only changed by an hour or so, but several hours and a stopover for a flight that should take about an hour is a big leap.    To give Lufthansa some credit, they did say we should be entitled to a refund. My boyfriend said the customer service was good when he called them up. Sadly we cannot get our flight refunded because we didnt book directly through Lufthansa, and the travel agency we booked with wont allow it.\n",

      "    After several flights with Lufthansa I was ordering a flight for three persons to the US. After the quite long order process theres an error, when I try to pay. I call to their support as prompted. They tell me to start over as its a common problem, when Im signed in to their system (which must be very irritating for their loyal costumers). I do, but when Im about to place the order, the price has gone 168 EUR up. I call again and the agent promises to refund the 168 EUR if I just place the order. If he had not told me this I would have gone with British Airlines instead, which also is a four-star airline and was cheaper to begin with. Some weeks after Ive sent my e-mail I hear nothing from Lufthansa. So I try to contact them by mail. Here I get standard answers with rude remarks. After I tell them that Ill pass it on to my lawyers, they promise to forward the case to the right department (why not do this at once instead of after 4 e-mails?). Weeks after this I receive a letter telling me about how they price their tickets and that they will not refund anything - no discussion. Furthermore they choice to place a man weighing no less than 150 kg besides me on my 11 hour flight, which took up half of my seat. This is not the passengers fault, but so large people should have two seats so they dont take up other passengers room. Well, thanks a lot Lufthansa, well never meet again.\n",

      "    Flights are always clean, service efficient and the catering offering in Europe one of the better ones.  The hot wraps are really tasty. Unless you get a cheap deal prices can sky rocket, and lack of a business lounge at major airports like Heathrow loses them a star.\n",

      "    I flew with Lufthansa 4 times already, two times short and two times long distance. The long distance flight was awesome: excellent service, nice & experienced staff, great Media Centre with lots of movies to pick. The short distance flights were both delayed and the boarding was very weird, at first I thought wow this is superquick but then everybody was cramped in the dark tunnel in front of the plane and standing around for at least 15 minutes instead of still staying in the boarding hall and doing it properly, with back seats first and so on. I have mixed feelings about this airline, I would need to fly with it again to see in which direction it is going. But unfortunately most of the times its a very pricey option, although they land at the most convenient airports. Lets see!\n",

      "    I fly often, and choose Lufthansa more than half of the time. I find it very reliable and with relatively low prices when booking online some time in advance.  The only reason I dont vie 5 stars is that the online pricing can be confusing, since they full price including all fees (which can be half of the ticket price) is not given until the very end of the booking cycle. Thus it is very difficult to compare prices with other airlines in searches.\n",

      "    I booked to fly from UK to Frankfurt via Dusseldorf for a sporting event.  The event was changed to Dusseldorf so I called Lufthansa to cancel the last leg of the journey only to be told by a South African woman that I couldnt do that and needed to buy a whole new ticket.  I ended up on the plane with two seats going to the same place.  Thanks for nothing Lufthansa.  Terrible customer service but the flight was good.  I now loathe to use them again.\n",

      "    Very nice service on board. No complaints!  But to book a 9 hour flight from Frankfurt to Denver, and not being told, that there are NO inflight entertainment system at your seat.  Thats a very looong flight...    Get rid of the old planes, especially on the long haul flights.\n",

      "    I flew to South Africa in May on Lufthansas flagship A-380 on economy. There is a definite feeling of being made to feel that you are in economy on this airline. On the super jumbo my entertainment system did not work. The staff were not particularly concerned. On the way back the entire section of the aircrafts entertainment system did not work. They offered alternative seats elsewhere about 2 hours into the flight but no isle or upgrades so I stayed in my seat. So no movies etc. They said to write and complain. I did. I got an automated reply that they were busy. Its been two months now and they never got back to me. Clearly Lufthansa is a mediocre airline, not a top one. In general its an airline for the staff and one gets the impression that although attentive, there is plenty room for improvement in service standards. How about trying to get back on all customers complaints within 7 days! Surely this is possible. They serve nothing but pretzels as a snack between meals. Again the feeling of \"you are in economy - get used to it\" etc etc. Its clearly deliberate. I will try another airline next time if I can. Just an all round mediocre experience. Shame. Such potential.\n",

       "'    Stay away from this  They care only about themselves     My cancelled and refund assured and im still wating for it!     Disgraceful. Flights cancelled and refund assured on 18 March. Still nothing and so comfortable with it. This is a stalling technique and it is scurrilous. Give people their money back for the service not provided. Quoting Corona is insulting our intelligence. Its now double the 30 day refund regulation. Unbelievable conduct.     Its a little frustrating to have to call, but it was pretty easy to get my flights refunded (due to cancellation from the virus).  Managed to get through to the German HQ after a few technical issues (only had to wait approx 12 mins to get through to a person) and requested a refund for my flights- which the lady on the other end automatically processed! Only issue is there is no clear timeframe for when the funds will be refunded.     If expect people to accept an alternative rather than refund during covid times then they need to offer options beyond April 2021, and get a Web system for rebooking.     Scammers, i can never cancel my ticket. (Sunexpress)     I have had a pleasant time with customer service , to be honest my Call was generally picked up in 1-1:30 minute by someone and they were kind enough to rebook ticket for me. Which I solely wanted.  has been great and wish to travel with you soon. I know the crisis has hit each and everyone of us  not only the airlines but customers , we shant forget that there 100s of thousands who have gone through this , so yeah refunds might take time but it will happen. Trust the Germans     I took a nearly full from London to Frankfurt today due to private emergency.   The seats including middle were nearly all full around me. I asked and challenged the stewards on duty why are they putting passengers safety at risk even just to make the middle seat free for sake of health of passengers and they said was outside their control. The ticket price was also exceptionally high for this experience. I hope this is not trying to profiteer out of the current situation now that virtually all competition is not flying. I am a Senator card holder and flown many times however this experience has started to changed my opinion about this and really hope profits are not put forward instead of safety passenger. Who is accountable for making such decisions as staff seem to shirk it off as not their fault.     Booked flights through Expedia and they were cancelled due to Coronavirus. Expedia very unhelpful and telling me what I knew to be untrue about Terms so called directly. Spoke to a gentleman in their German office who was really really helpful. Excellent service. Just wished Id booked directly with and not through Expedia, certainly will do so in the future.     Update: finally gave up trying to force or pretend vouchers was the only option available. Agreed to receive full refund and the transaction has been fully reverted now. Still giving 3/5 given the situation shouldnt have been this complicated.   Horrendous experience calling customer \"services\" today, amid all this corona virus madness my flights got cancelled and tried to see options to rebook. This was a holiday I booked almost a year in advance and was meant to be the highlight of our year.  This horrible lady who didnt say her name was awful, when I enquired about changing the flights to later in the year she said it would cost me £2.400 per customer (original flights were £1100 for two!). When I asked her why it was so much more expensive she said it was my fault for changing the flights!!   I confronted her saying that I could see in webpage the flights I asked for were quoted for £1200 both passenger so I couldnt understand why she was quoting such a difference, her answer was: \"if you dont like the option I gave you just book and paid whatever you want and loose your other .  Honestly, Id appreciate someone from to come back to me and explain why can an employee be so rude and disrespectful, her job is to help customers to get the best out of this situation and not rip people off!  I must say when I called again later and a nice gentleman helped me and managed to changed the flights free of charge.. so probably the other employee was after some commission or a tap in then shoulder for sale records..  Anyway, will never book with this company again.     cancelled. Please call for a refund ? Why you dont refund automatically unless somebody  calls or fill online rebooking form? It takes you minutes to take money from customers accounts and weeks to return it ?     Excellent Service- full refund received due to cancellation Due to Lockdown and Covid-19 Highly Recommend- will always use      To whom it may concern, My fiance and I were due to travel from New Zealand to Copenhagen to get married on the 6th of June 2020. However, due to Covid-19 raging in the World, our flights by Emirates were cancelled by the and they were so kind to re-book our trip for later this year at no cost. In fact, everything was cancelled. Our wedding venue, the Church where we supposed to get married, our honeymoon. I think most people can imagine the sadness and disappointment my fiance and I felt. We were working hard for 2 years to be able to afford the wedding and we were looking forward to finally celebrate with our loved ones. On that note, my fiances mother was supposed to travel from Costa Rica to Crakow (where the wedding celebrations were originally going to be held) to see her son &#8211; whom she hasnt seen for 3 years &#8211; getting married. So we called hoping that they would re-book her  They wouldnt. They said that because it hasnt yet been cancelled, we need to pay another 900 Euros to change the dates to later this year. Same route, same time, same everything &#8211; but a different date. It is in my opinion so irresponsible, first of all, for not to suspend that when Emirates cancelled our flights on the same date. And second of all, to not be helpful in this time of crisis for everyone. It is incredibly disappointing to see how greedy some companies can be and taking advantage of this pandemic while the whole world has come together united spreading kindness and compassion. Obviously, we arent canceling our wedding, our trip, our honeymoon, my fiances mothers trip, by choice, but because we were forced by the current situation to do so. Be safe, be kind, safe lives.     Very good experience. Fly was perfect. Friendly and very helpful personal. Services on the top. We recommend.     I was told on March 10 that would refund my money for a cancelled  Today is April 2, over 3 weeks later, and I have still not received my money. When I called today, I was told to \"be patient.\" Tell me, why did United Airlines (despite whatever you might think of United) refund my money for the identical 2 days later?! How much time does it take to credit my credit card?! Why is intentionally hanging on to my money?     Have been in contact with customer service a couple of times during this corona pandemic, and every time has been a blessing. Very service minded, helping as best they can and just being nice. Quick to answer too! Only have one name at hand now, Sylvia at YPQ centre in Toronto, but you are all awesome! Keep up the good work people!     Despite sending several emails and being unable to get through on the telephone after successfully claiming a refund for my flights online, I have not received a penny back. Been almost a month now and cant get through to speak to anyone or get a response via email. Crooks stole my money and now wont refund after cancelling my  Stay away     We were promised a refund back from our cancelled flights due to COVID 19, after several attempts to get my money back they keep telling me to be patient. It took them .2 seconds to take my money,....GIVE IT BACK! Stay away from      So I booked a return trip from Copenhagen to Greece with and there are 4 flights in total. 2 of my flights were canceled and I was not notified, I only found out later when I log in to check my bookings on their site. I eventually canceled the trip and asked for refund. After countless calls and emails to their non-existing customer support I have finally gave up, I never heard back from them. Please keep this in mind and never fly with again     Added transfer to my direct  so I have to spend whole day traveling now, cannot cancel the and get my money back!     It is impossible to get in touch with Customer Service these days. I have tried several times lately in vain. Waited for a long time each time. Ok I understand that there might be a lot of phone calls due to corona situation, but this is not acceptable. Make a queue system or something like that     We will never fly again! Very bad handling of the coronavirus crisis. Non existent customer support line. No options for online rebook. Their marketing of goodwill offer for flexible booking only works for their publicity and nothing else. Our is due on March 25, our booking ref is LL9YKR.  We tried calling UK and Germany call center but couldnt get through. Then we were recommended by the Facebook comment and their chatbot that due to the call volume, we should make use of their flexible option online. So we tried going ahead with the cancellation hoping to see rebook options in the next step.  No rebook possible online! We lost our flights and now it is as if we voluntarily cancel our booking without making use of their flexible options!  Please resolve this issue!  Lots of customers depends on your very poor management.  Im usually a big fan of the but I will not fly anymore!     Hi,  We have booked a to Tokyo that we would like to cancel. This due to the Swedish foreign department issue a warning from any travel abroad, due to corona virus. I have really tried to reach you by several calls but after somewhat 3 times 20 minutes in phone cue, being hanged up upon! Therefore I want to make this formally: If like to cancel our trip : booking id: 1502409834  And we also like to know how we can use this amount of 1600 € to fly with you later this year when things are back to normal . Best regards, Antonio Rossiello Schön and Felicia Hellqvist     A very big thank you to the team for our repatriation back to the UK from Munich after a snowboarding accident. Your staff, friendliness and expertise made a pretty harrowing return journey home on a stretcher seem so much easier.   Many thanks for all your help and kindness. David and Lorraine     Booked an early morning from TSR to LHR in January for Mar 22.  Yesterday I get an email from advising me of confirmation of a booking on 3/22 but a hours later.   No explanation in the email, so logging in and looking saw the earlier was not listed, so surmised they canceled that one and dumped everyone to the later - problem was, that time didnt work for the rest of the itinerary and online said it couldnt be changed or refunded(remember, cancelled the original and unilaterally rebooked on a much later ..)  Well, three calls to their customer service (waiting 30 mins to over an hour before having to give up and hung up to do other things i needed to do), and an email un-responded to, this evening I finally reached a woman in C/S after another 30+ min wait on hold, and she was very arrogant and rude - when I suggested they put the option to change the booking online when does this, she insisted you could - I assured her you couldnt and offered a screen shot... but at least changed the booking to the day before to salvage the rest of the existing connecting travel (luckily could travel the day before)  Theres more, but gives the idea.  Hopefully the flying experience will not be as bad as the horrendous customer service treatment.  My first experience with and I travel a lot - likely my last unless they step up dramatically.   BTW other airlines like Delta have been great to deal with the crisis situation cause by COVID-19, so if doesnt have enough decently trained and empowered call center people, maybe its CEO and other execs need to jump in and take calls and help them.... ;)  Update Mar 17 -  They still direct you to call their service counter for most of their COVID-19 options vs handling online, which BTW Ive tried many times - results -0-  Rings, rings... disconnected w/o answering; few times it answers - on hold 20 - 45 mins+. Then it disconnects, so impossible to do anything with them...  Email attempts ... fruitless so far.  On the other hand, Delta Airlines - excellent and focused on its customers and communities.  Whats so challenging about this   Why can others step up and you can not?  Update: 4/18 - Finally after a week of trying to call and email, connected with an agent and they arranged a full refund - so thanks to them... Will up my rating from 1-star to 3-star for finally taking care of this because they put me through hell and lots of effort and time on my part to reach this point, where Delta was in front of the curve and deserved their 5-stars.  Update 4/9/20 - Well, still no refund despite 23-days passing.  Recent email with their customer services:  On 4/7 \"The agent you spoke on the phone sent the ticket to the queue for refund. This is the right procedure. The refund is processed in the ticketing department, not by the customer service agent. Since the ticketing department has been overwhelmed with requests, your refund is still waiting processing. Unfortunately, we cannot provide you with a timeframe. We understand that this is frustrating and we sincerely apologize. Please keep monitoring your account. Your refund will be processed eventually. Best regars, Bilyana Borislavova German Airlines\"  Prior one on 4/6 - \"Thank you for your emails. Please accept our apologies for the late reply caused by high volume of requests received in the past month.  I have checked your request and I see you have already cancelled the booking. Your request for refund is noted and it will be fulfilled. Our service centers, however, are at present giving priority to necessary rebookings and the coordination of repatriation flights. We are also aware of the legal situation and refunds of course continue to remain possible. We kindly ask for your understanding that due to the current situation it is not possible to uphold the usual deadlines. Best regards, Adriana Cvetkovic German Airlines\"  They really make in challenging and complicated - many layers and people - making you call - to do all but vouchers, so it appears to me they are likely trying to avoid paying out cash at the moment, event willing to break the law in doing so?  Many were tested by this pandemic, and airlines like Delta stepped up and even went further and did more than asked, so they have my business for life  .... beware of this company dear future travelers!!!!  Update 4/23 -  Even though I was told by the Customer Rep on 4/18 my refund was submitted and to expect it within 3-10 days,  30+ days later - nothing!    In emails and a phone call, got the they dont know when, that dept is overwhelmed, no there is no way to contact them directly blah, blah, bah....  I agree with some others - they are doing everything to hold onto customers money to keep operating and they are breaking the law.     I flew and it was really nice. I dont understand why people are rating it so badly. I mean, it isnt the BEST PLANE EVER, but, it was still a really nice experience and I would like to fly it again. Here is what I think about   Comfort- 4/5 stars food- 3/5 stars Baggage capacity-5/5 stars Cabin Crew- 5/5 stars Takeoff- 5/5 stars Landing- 3/5 stars     Flew with them many times and am always happy with their service. Expensive but worth it!     I purchased flights from a third party to Italy a few weeks back and was looking to cancel due to Coronavirus. I was told multiple times that I had to request a refund from the agency, but the payment went through to the  I have tried calling customer support twice and have waited for more than an HOUR before hanging up. I used to be a big fan of this and will no longer be flying with them after this experience.     I rebooked the twice, paid for it twice and issued only one invoice for two payment. I see in the bank transaction two invoice numbers, but the second invoice is not possible do download. The message is that the invoice doesnt exist.   I tried with sending more than one email to customer relation, then calling help desk and another number that first help desk shared. No one was able to help, and just sending me in circles from one help desk to another.   I still dont have the invoice and cannot reimburse the cost from  my company.     Baggage not delivered during my stay in Munich: sent my baggage to the Frankfurt airport instead of the Munich Airport: it was a direct ! As my stay was shorter than 4 days they refused to send my baggage to my hotel in Munich and they let me without any update until the date of departure. At my return, I have requested some explanations from  Their answer: \"we are sorry but you should contact the local baggage authorities and hoping to see you next on our flights!!!\"     It just feels safe, but they are expensive     Excellent customer service (although not very fast in response).  Very reasonable with customer requests, responsive, and great in-air service.     The worst Ive ever travelled with.   My friend (from Canada visiting me in CPH) and I was flying from Copenhagen to Malaga Oct 2019. Luggage did not arrive in Malaga, we were told it would arrive in the evening - fine, it happens, but... the luggage never arrived and no one reached out to us. When we reached out to and airport no one could inform us where the luggage was or when it would arrive. One week later we flew back to Copenhagen (luggage never arrived). To make matters worse my friend flew back to Canada with no luggage. Luckily it showed up 3 weeks later. Told myself I would NEVER travel with again, because customer service (or lack thereof) was absolutely TERRIBLE. To make matters worse we paid about $140 extra for luggage and seat selection only to have them seat us seperately and no luggage to check-in.    2 months later - January 2020 - I booked a a return from Los Angeles to Copenhagen with United (or thats what I thought). Turned out the back (10,5 hr long  was operated by  I was honestly really annoyed because I was not informed about this by my agency. However, I accepted it and made sure to check-in online early and a book seat (because theres no way Im sitting middle-seat on a 10-11 hr . Prior to boarding they ask me to come to the desk on the sepaker and they tell me they have to change my seat. The reason: Another person booked that seat too. Is this a joke? How can 2 people book the same seat. Hello... This is 2020. Anyways I tell them its fine as long as they assign me another aisle seat or at the very least a window seat. Then she has the audacity to say: Im sorry this is a fully booked  I can only assign you a middle seat. Im a pretty patient customer. Flying to and from North America a lot, I have encountered my fair share problems with  But this was the last straw. DO YOURSELF A FAVOUR AND STAY AWAY FROM      App is good, nice to get updates from them. Nothing bad to say really     I had from Toronto to Iran on January 23th 2020 and return from Iran to Toronto on February 5th 2020 .5 days before the sent me the e-mail and canceled all to Iran until April 01 2020. Please note I purchase this ticket 3, 4 month back I had surgery in Iran on February 02 2020. They asked me to call customer service for more assistance. I called them immediately and customer service rep told me all canceled for security reason , I asked for rebook ticket with other as all other such as Qatar , Emirate and Turkish still continuing flights to Iran , she told me unfortunately we cannot rebook and the only option they gave me is full refund , I told her I purchased this ticket long time ago and if I wanted to replace it with any other with such short time frame I have to pay 3,4 times more expensive on price and I cannot afford it anymore , she asked me to contact customer relation by e-mail . I have sent them e-mail and explained the situation on January 18 2019. They reply me back on January 20th that someone will contact me shortly and for any other question I can call  I was so frustrated and called and canceled my surgery in Iran. the day after I have called for follow up as after days I havent received any respond, this time the representative told me they can rebook me with any other , I was super upset as I already canceled my surgery and asked them how come no one offered me this option before and again no answer from the rep but \"I am sorry sir\" .  I told them to rebook me again and after 30 min waited on phone they dropped  call on me , I called them again and asked the for rebook, this time representative told me they can only book me same date ! I asked them it ok just please rebook me with any  again after 25 min waiting they dropped the call on me again honestly I could not believe my experience but I did not give up and I called them again and this time I asked if I can talk to supervisor or manager as reps keep dropping my call and the representative told me no I cannot connect you to manager! I was not able to believe this , I never had such disaster costumer service experience in my life , they were forcing me to cancel my without giving me any other option . Now after a week I have not received any call or e-mail form  I canceled my surgery in Iran, I didnt even received my refund for ticket. For the first time in my life I feel not only I have no right as passenger for them but also I have no human right they dont even bother to answer me. I need someone to please advise me how and where can I claim my rights as I feel super upset and do not know what to do .     Customer service is very poor but the flights are all comfy and on time. Make sure you double check everything before flying.     On our from Frankfurt to Hong Kong in December, the food was poor, eg, dry sandwiches and the entertainment system was malfunctioning. Unfortunately, this fault meant that our two children could not get the games nor the movies working, making for a very long  We had this exact same issue 2 years ago and I thought that would have fixed it. On the positive side, the food, service and the entertainment system were much better on the Hong Kong to Munich return  So it seems its a bit of a mixed bag with  Their prices are keen but you may not get the service you expect from a large  Im particular, watch out for the flights out of Frankfurt to the Asian hubs Shanghai and Hong Kong.     A trip from Copenhagen to Rio de Janeiro  - Delayed 13 hours - Ticket prize charged twice from bank account - Customer service cant help by phone  I would expect at least to have a full refund of my ticket after this kind of \"service\" if I was going to use again or recommend it to others.     Dealing with damaged luggage.  I just want to know who was the insane Manager or CEO at that decided to outsource customer service to India and then make them request power of attorney from the affected person in Europe in order to be able to process their personal data to solve their issue! Have you all gone insane for profits? Dont you have enough? Look below the standard message that I have received from 3 different individuals:  \"Kindly be advised, the previously submitted Power of Attorney was deemed invalid. The Power of Attorney cannot be authorized by the passenger herself, it is preferred that a third party must authorize the Power of Attorney.\" - What the hell do you mean  by a third party? Do I need to go to a lawyers office for them to authorize the POA and then send it back to you? Is this stuff even real? You afford this kind of trash just because you have a monopoly and nobody regulates you, I am so glad that you are constantly hit by strikes.     I had to book for my Europe travel because it was pretty much the only option available. I had the expectation that it was going to be a decent because it is \"German\" and Germans brag about their quality and attention to detail.  Well one was worst than the other:  1. Unfriendly Staff 2. Very average plane  3. Poor quality food  4. Extra alcohol was served to drunk passengers that were singing the whole night on my to Madrid and they kept receiving more alcohol ... so we could not sleep the whole night   My flights were:  1. HongKong to Frankfurt  2. Frankfurt Madrid return  3. Today Munich to Beijing and to finish ruining my trip we are a family of three with an infant and this brag about being \"FAMILY friendly\" well they have given us sits separate all over the plane... no help and no respect.  This is without a doubt the worse I have ever used, such a big disappointment.  I live in Australia and I am used to the great service we receive from Qantas, I think Germany needs a decent aerline.     I am truly shocked by how bad the service at is. This is the first time I am flying this and I am shocked, shocked, shocked.  The website is NOT user-friendly. I tried to check-in online but could not see the seat that I have been allocated.   After very frastrating 30 minutest trying to check in online I decided to call for support.   The greeting was way too complicated and there were too many options to choose from. Then an operator from Manilla answered the phone. The line was really poor quality and I had no choice but to pot down the phone and try again.  The second attempt was a disaster too. After I was greeted by the foreign-speaking agent the line simply cut off so I gave up on trying to check-in online or to find out where am I seating.   get your operations in order. You should have your support in Germany since you are a german carrier. Improve the quality of the telephone support and most importantly invest some money in improving the user experience on your website.   TRULY SHOCKED HOW BAD MY FIRST EXPERIENCE WAS WITH YOUR AS AN   NEVER AGAIN.     To be fair, I should say it was an easy check in, smooth  clean cabins. But they served a tiny dinner and nothing till next morning .it was about 11 hours  Most interesting part was the breakfast. A muffin the size of an egg, and a single grape and 3 little pieces of pineapple in a tiny container. As price of the tickets goes higher and higher the airlines become cheaper and cheaper. Soon they are going to sell rabish sandwiches in international as they sell in american national flights.     Our was delayed for just over an hour for some reason and were unable to make our connection from Munich to Denver. Katarina Alt delivered delightful service and support by rebooking our for the next day and paying for a few shuttle passes from the airport to Holiday Inn Express and also paying for our hotel accommodations there as well. We were able to head into Munich using the train (S8), due to the helpful staff at the Holiday Inn and had a blast visiting the Christmas Markets. We had a great time and are so thankful to Katarina and and Holiday Inn Express for going to extra mile for us. Highly recommend working with all three.     One of the best in Europe !  Travelled several times to Germany and through to other contnental destination. The service was perfect, on time, free food and drinks on board at a very competitive price.  Will certainly fly with them again !     Booked around the world trip premium econ from Melbourne to Singapore 3 nights-UK via Frankfurt -5 weeks, after river trip Budapest to Los Angeles 5 nights-LA Auckland 3 nights- NZ to Melbourne. We had a problem at Budapest as our Visa to the USA had a typo error and we couldnt board, we manage to get the visa corrected within 2 hours but the gates had shut, we fully realise we are at fault here but the help desk at the airport wouldnt even consider we pay for another at our cost to be able to continue our once in a lifetime trip, I mean there is no more work for the as the bookings continued from LA six days later, the help desk said they would continue the trip for $9000 AU, if that is not calculating corporate greed to leave us stranded in a foreign country with limited funds with absolutely no compromise or kind judgement from them at all, we practically lost most of our US and NZ bookings for hotel car hire and transfers as well, not to mention getting home somehow. We feel that someone in your management system requires a humanity adjustment as that was one low down grubby money grabbing act.without any compassion at all, we still cannot get are heads around why this unreasonable decision was made against us other than sheer greed and because you could, I would love to meet the coward man who made all the decisions sitting behind a phone line. I see looking at the www that do not rate to well, well I can assure you I will do my utmost to help your ratings drag along. We consider this barbaric act against us for no just cause to be the lowest heinous and outright attack we have ever witnessed.   Feedback ID 33209842 James William Stephenson Lorraine Edith Stephenson Budapest airport Wednesday 17th July No LH1675 @ 08:50 Hr     Im suprised to see so many negative reviews on  They are one of the best airlines in the world. Great clean planes, customer service and top notch attendants. Well at least my experiences with flying them.     i had the greatest experience with  When I checked in, the service lady went through my entire booking to make sure I liked my seats, recommended meals that I had preordered should be cancelled because they were worse than the regular meals at that time, and checked my extra hand luggage in for me so I only had to carry my handbag. She was just the nicest!! And the whole way, everything was smooth sailing and comfortable, and the regular meals were pretty good!     What a waste of an  What a waste of a crew and ground staff with even shittier attitudes. Their delayed from Oslo left me with 20 mins at Munich to catch my to Singapore. I ran to the gate mentioned on the app to find the gate had been changed. Literally ran to the flip side of the airport (because German airports are pure excrement). I was the last person to arrive only 5 mins before time. But since this was also  it was ofcourse late too.  Arrived in Singapore to find out that our luggage never made it. There was NOT a single person from to offer an explanation or apology. They had outsourced a third party company to offer us shut-up petty cash.   I refused your cash  Keep it. You need it more to feed your ghastly team.   P.S. Thank you for the notification I received a day later for the change of gate. So helpful!  What great reflection of Germany!     Probably the best I have ever dealt with. Never had an issue     Booked with  they took the money as youd expect, put the money back in, then took the money back out and changed my with a 7 hour lay over and a 9 hour layover return which was originally 2 and 3. Ive had 5 emails in the last 3 weeks saying theyd refund me where they havent! Easyjet or Whizz are the safer bets. Still down £180.     Tribble experience with customer service on phone using phone number provided for Canada.1-800-563-5954 I called 3 times to obtain some information about the refund that I hadnt still got for the tickets that I cancelled 20 days ago. The first call was answered by an Indian accent lady who was so reluctant to look at my file and would barely answer my question. I had to call again hoping that I would get a better customer service representative. The second time was connected to an Indian accent guy who was clearly eating something while talking to me. He asked me whethere he can put me on hold to investigate, and I was on hold for 20 minutes. I got frustrated and hung up the phone and dialed again. Finally the third time I get connected to a helpful lady that looked up my file and answered in less than 3 minutes.  I would never book with again because of this kind of service they provide to the customers. I hope management would take care of better serving their customers by reviewing their customer service representatives performance.     Terrible customer service at the ticket counter at Ohare airport.  Lady was snippy from the moment I walked up to the counter.  I was putting my suitcase on the scale and she wanted my passport and I felt like I was being rushed but there was no lines.  Once I gave her my passport, she said in an unfriendly manner \"your passport is not signed.\"  I explained that it was a new passport and I would be happy to sign it. She then got me checked in and said do you have a carry-on. I said yes and I showed her my carry-on she said well it has to fit in the container over there. I said ok but much to my surprise it did not fit. Been using the same carry-on for 10 years never had a problem with it before. It was very evident looking at the container that it was sized differently than what Ive typically seen in the past, width was skinnier.   I told her Id never had any issues before and she said something about the sizes have recently changed but then she said something like always enforces the size limitations.  She suggested that I check the bag which I could not do because it had my computer and some other items I needed on the  I tried a couple different times and ways to fit the bag in the container but it was about 1/2 inch too big at the wheels.  I ended up having to repack my suitcases and I threw away my carry-on because there was no reason to check it and everything could fit in my regular bag that I was checking. The real kicker was when I was going through the gate area and boarding the plane there was another container to check your size bags and it was the kind that I had seen in the past in my bag would have easily fit in that one. In addition they were people with much larger bags taking them on the plane is carry-ons. I am extremely perplexed at what the problem was and why there are two different sizes containers for people to test their bags ..  a much smaller size at the ticket counter and a regular size at the gate. Is it just a ploy to get people to check more bags?  The idea that my bag was too large in and of its self is understandable because of the various regulations. However the part that is not understandable and absolutely not acceptable with her attitude and tone that she took with me from the moment I walked up to the ticket counter. The other unacceptable aspect of the situation is having two different size containers for people to check their bags.   Thank goodness my checked bag made it to my destination otherwise I wouldve had no spare clothing do use until it arrives.     Cancelled my from Athens to Birmingham - then rerouted me on a later via Doha! Utter joke!     Ill make this as short as possible. During my vacation a major natural disaster occurred near my home, resulting in over 200,000 people being evacuated and over 1 million without power. My entire home County was in a mandatory evacuation zone experiencing a massive fire, as such returning on my scheduled was not a option. This was international news and of course able to be verified. The first call I got hung up on after holding for a half hour then the second call took an entire hour. The best was willing to do was allow be to change the date of my  but I had to pay a significant up charge (hundreds) and they were not willing to work with me to change the departure airport which cost me hundreds more in accommodations. As someone in customer service I understand the purpose of policy, but when massive natural disasters and evacuations occur, one would hope a good business would provide some more leeway. To be clear the quality itself has not been an issue, but I would give their customer service a solid 1 star and will never fly with them again.     We havent flown yet and I am regretting it already. We booked return tickets for the family including our 1 year old for next year and werent sure if we would get bassinet seats so I went online to their site. After much search the system response was basically booking through a third party company should be dealt with by them . I then specifically wrote to them requesting reservation for those seats and after days of waiting, below are the answer:  \"It will be against a fee of EUR 35,00 (€) per seat per to reserve in advance.  As seating cannot be reserved via email, in order for you to reserve your seats in advance for either of these flights you can contact our Colleagues in the Reservations Department as the seats are chargeable to reserve in advance.   You will be able to locate the number on the website; www. Customer services > Help & Contact > Service Center/bookings and service enquiries  Alternatively you will be able to reserve your seating on the website via the following process,  www. My Bookings > details > Seat Reservations > Add/change seats  Please note, however, that you will not be able to reserve the Bassinet Seating online.\"  So here go, back to step one ! Far out .     Okay to my home country Colombia, nice staff     I have never had such bad customer service. To book and pay them, there are every option possible and theyll make sure they are reachable and responsive within the minute. But once you have a problem with your (eg. they made a cancellation and they have to refund you). There is no hotline for you to call. Only e-mails and they will answer you once every 3 weeks. Good luck when there is something that they get wrong and you have to explain again. They are not the smartest of the bunches neither. Its now been 4 months, and we havent seen our money back.  So brace yourself if there is a problem with your and they owe you money. You probably wont get it back. Like we didnt.     My luggage has gone missing from a Eurowings on Sunday and is yet to be found.  I checked it in in Zagreb and had a layover in Cologne, and no one can tell me in which city the suitcase is or when its going to be flown to Lisbon.  The Eurowings tracer is useless, it doesnt give me any updates and theyre not picking up the phone. I am literally waiting at the moment for my call to be answered and have been on hold for more than 30 minutes twice today. Their social media agents are just as useless, they simply redirect customers to an email address that apparently no one is checking.  So far, the only reply I got was an automated macro:  \"Dear Ladies and Gentlemen,  Thank you for your request registered under the following Ticket ID:420736  Resolving your request and answering questions are a top priority for us. A member of our support team will follow up with you in a timely matter to resolve your inquiry.  Currently the processing may take up to 4 weeks, therefore we kindly ask you to refrain from further status inquiries.  You can track the status of your delayed baggage under (link).  If you would like to submit additional documents or information on an existing inquiry, we kindly ask you to use the reply function of your email program. Please submit copies of your documents as email attachments.  Thank you for your understanding.\"  The process cannot take 4 weeks, it cannot even take 4 days as I need my luggage back as soon as possible, for obvious reasons. I had the same problem on the way there but was dealing with a far more competent who was able to deliver my bag ON THE SAME DAY. Eurowings hadnt even put in the information on the tracker that I had taken a from Zagreb to Cologne and were only trying to trace my luggage back to the from Cologne to Lisbon.  In the meantime, Im trying yet again to get connected to a support agent on the German line, after trying the Portuguese one, but none of your lines seem to be working.  I tried contacting you on Facebook as well, but the reply I got was the following:  \"Dear Raquel, Im sorry to hear about your delayed baggage. According to international regulations, the last operating is responsible. Please keep in touch with Eurowings or the telephone number on your loss report - they are the right point of contact. Apologies for any inconvenience caused - I hope you will be reunited with your bags soon! /John\"  I will keep sending you \"further status inquiries\" on all channels available, including Lufthansas, until I get a concrete answer on where my bag is and when it will be delivered.  As Eurowings parent company you really should be more concerned about their customers.     I have never had an experience such as this one. The most complicated and convoluted way of registering then when trying to create a Miles&More account I have received a BLANK pdf instead of my login details. No way of resetting the PIN, not via the link on the email, not on the website. Tried the phone, after a long wait I was told they could only resend my PIN BY POST! And then they disconnected me. This is truly appalling. I have all sorts of loyalty programs and even the EasyJet App is easier than this.     Excellent  always my first choice.     I went to Europe for honeymoon of 15 days euro trip.I landed Paris on 28/09/2019 by LH1040 from Frankfurt to CDG.My checked in baggage didnt arrived at CDG airport. For bag claim, I filled the form at airport for baggage claim with & got a receipt with file reference number.They said the reference number can be used to check the status of baggage online. The status was blank untill 29/01/2019. On 30/09/2019,the status changed directly to delivery in progress. There was no status in between,like bag is located at Frankfurt airport or bag arrived at CDG airport. I kept waiting for the baggage whole day no one called nor the bag was delivered. I was in Paris untill 01/10/2019 till 5:00 am(1st Oct).It was promised that I will get my bag before 01/10/2019, which never happened. While leaving Paris from CDG airport to Zurich, I went to baggage claim counter and provided them with my new address for next three days(04/10/2019)i.e; Luzern. I was again promised that my bag will be sent to Zurich with next on 01/10/2019, which again didnt happened. I kept calling customer care baggage claim department and everyone promised that it will arrive Zurich within given time frame. I assume, that the guy whom I spoke to while leaving CDG airport, updated my address but didnt cancelled my delivery in Paris. On 3/10/2019(3rd Oct),I got call from a delivery guy in Paris and he wanted to deliver the bag to me in Paris. So fact is, didnt even inform the delivery department about the address change for 3 working days. Hence,the delivery person didnt retuned my bag to at CDG airpor. should have cancelled the delivery on same day 01/10/2019 at 8:00 am(when I visited them). I kept calling them and kept telling me that bag will arrive in Zurich before 4th October.Todays is 3rd October and bag is still in Paris and with courier/delivery department(not at Paris airport). Hence I am still in Europe with 1 jacket,a sandal,a t-shirt and a purse. No toothpaste, shampoo,long coat & my DSLR.Like a beggar,I travelled Europe. All you can do is keep calling the and they will say delivery in progress but they dont even know that delivery is scheduled for which address.They say bag is located but they dont know the airport or city name. There is no way that you can escalate it. there is nothing called as priority,not for free nor for a price which I was ready to pay for there mistake. It was my honeymoon trip in Europe.I was supposed to be in Paris for 15 days because no one does that. I came to visit multiple countries and cities in Europe. Worst part, I had to water same jeans and t-shirt for 5 days. My boots were inside the checked in bag and thus I had to visit to the cold places in sandals and my husbands shoes.  doesnt care for what you are going its shame in the name of customer service.     The only company that i have never had problems with!     By this company Flew not once by the ocean and always got best comfortable flys. Easy change tickets times by phone. always fast check-in online. This company I always will choose for my others flys and recommend all     One of the best airlines I have travelled till, but had experienced some very low class service on my one trip with  Two things are not very well that staff doesnt know properly about giving and serving service especially in terms of food and staff are always in haste. Plus Economy class passengers for any airlines are back bone base of customers and serving cold food and saying that they cant put it in microwave for economy guys has really posted a bad impression on customers. My overall experience with this airlines is very good except these two issues as they totally depend on the behavior of staff at that time as staff service defines the major part of overall service.     Really good service during recent trip from Birmingham to Bonn. Will fly with again     A terrible experience with com submitted by phone from 2nd September 2019 and still unresoolved , countless calls after my father was unconscience and rushed by ambulance to Helligen Giest Hospital in Frankfurt as he was unable to follow Lufthansas and Frankfurt Airports protocol being unconscience so not being able to accept his Backage Tag.   He had 2 checked in bags but they only have one suitcase of his and just hang up the phone as they cant be bothered to do their jobs. They say there customer care department is not containable by phone (hello this is the 21st century) so we are only able to email a complaint through Lufthanss website, I have submitted feedback via their website and it asks me for my back details, WHY do they ask me that????   Unless you can locate our lost bags (which we find worrying in an airport) which we think is appalling considering you operate in an airport, which is considered heightened security.   We fly every other month so consider us a valuable customer considering long distance flights are circa £1,000 but unless this terrible experience with is satisfactorily resolved will only fly with your competitors British Airways or Iberia, who cannot do enough for their customers and create a fun, stress free experience, I suggest the senior managers of look into their competitors on how to run an company.  We await for feedback.  @Lufthansa_DE @Airport_FRA  DO NOT FLY WITH  TERRIBLE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE WITH      For Business Class travel, there is nothing this provides that can be considered premium or outstanding. From cheapest-of-the-cheap economy seats to often missing priority boardings, the cherry on the cake is deciding to save on fast track queues in Heathrow.   Supersaver airlines like Easyjet do premium better to be honest. Will do my best to avoid going forward.     Several times I have got a with this  Everything was comfortable calm and on time.     Worste customer service ever. They responde to emails inat least 4 weeks (!!!). No chat support available, endless waiting on the phone. Unbelievable for a flagship airlines     Nasty trick to shun there responsibility  ?   Well I was suppose to fly 25 th aug we boarded the plain were we sat for 2 hours and 56 minutes at which point received a text cancelling the .... note just before 3 hours were I believe the law changes even though we sat on the plane a further 8 minutes ? We then headed back into Birmingham airport were the one representative who was obviously sick of the matter told everyone she was going for more staff and did a runner lol &#128514;yes never to be seen again ....( funny but discussing it was very late early hours and my 8 year old had suffered enough by now ... so luckily a policeman was pointing people in the direction of phones to call ... people queued for hours so I used my mobile through the stress  of waiting when through they eventually booked me on a for the 27th even though I asked if there were other airports or airlines there and answer was you can have a refund .... great ? So there I am 1am in the morning stuck in the airport now a very long day ... we headed home didnt even get there when received another txt message cancelling that ? Yes I think we we told almost anything to get us of the phones and out there hair .... I spent most of the night calling in the end I had to settle for flights 61 hours later almost half my holiday ... now has anybody tried to call customer services about problem compensation etc etc ... dont bother your given an e mail .... has any body tried to e mail ... well wouldnt bother almost impossible to get and when you do get it takes forever to come back to you over a weak just to say .... yes you guessed it sorry but your getting nothing ? Weather was bad ? Lol lol it was a storm for a few hours ! Night at the most  ... NOT 61 hours you didnt even try to get people to there destination quickly and affectively...and to top it all call customer services impossible .... Disgusting disgusting for a big modern company to try every trick in the book NOT to pay compensation and take responsibility ... e nailed quoting etc 261/2004 please note NO phone calls were supplied by your staff ... no travel expenses ..... no accommodation.... in fact you should read it again yourself but I will spell it out for you .... help and look after your customers &#128077;&#127997; Properly .. its all about the money for they dont care about write or wrong ..... you have a duty of care to your customers which you failed miserably..........your taking the extra 261 and bending it to please yourself ........................see you in court ?                            5/9/19 had a email quoting no compensation cancelled due to bad weather (for 61 hours)what? Anyway found a great website that deals with the claim  called resolver so now chasing through this will update later also NOTE this month used Turkish airlines one hour delay missed my connection e mailed them compensated me 400 euros no questions asked fantastic honourable company try learning by them instead of trying to get out of your responsibilities you disgust me to be honest ,,     Flew on 7.8.19 from Vancouver to Munich. The staff were very professional and the inflight service was very good. Had never flown with before but thank you to all the staff on the who worked so hard to ensure our long was as enjoyable as possible.     A really good experience flying with from Frankfurt to Toulouse yesterday. Very friendly and caring staff both at the gate and onboard the aircraft.  Looking forward to fly with you again.     Great!  Due to thunderstorms many flights were cancelled. In such a case doesnt have to pay anything, but they credited me as a good service Miles.     After day-long delay due to weather conditions they paid a compensation fee and I got a hotel room to stay at overnight. I did miss an event but they tried their best.     Pleasantly surprised, everything was good friendly staff, excellent.  Far better than other airlines such as Emirates which can be hit and miss.     Tired of waiting for a refund, one of there staf made a mistake and it is recorded but they dont  listen to the conversation - they say 7 days for a refund, but thats not true people are waiting- customer service is about giving the customer good service and promise what they say.     cool i enjoyed     I have flied with several times and have always been pleased with them. Even on quite short flights you get meal and drinks without extra cost. They dont use tricks to get you to pay extra fees as some other airlines does. Only one time there was a significant delay because of a strike and then we were compensated as we should. When I got sick once and could not get on my return they solved it smoothly and quickly gave me a ticket to a later  This is a serious and professional company. One of my first hand choices when I fly.     If I had the option of selecting minus 1 star rating that would truly be my choice.  I have been trying to reach a rep in Canada for several months to discuss special seating needs.     I have yet to speak to one. Each time Im connected to someone in another part of the world who is unable to assist me.  By farming out work globally, has clearly put profit before people and has sacrificed the quality of their customer service to the point where they have become unreachable and  almost non existent.  This will be the last time I fly with      This is one of my favorite airlines. Good food on board, good service. Rare aircraft delays. Keep it up!     was told 2 flights on the same day were cancelled but when I went onto the website I could see one still there and the other had been changed to 5 minutes earlier but the alternatives they gave me were hours later. They couldnt care less about their customers. I actually had the flights changed back by one of the customer service representatives only then to be changed back again and be told that he had no authority to do that by another customer service representative. Terrible customer service representatives on the phone do nothing but hang up on you no help whatsoever am trying to figure out why I was told my was cancelled when I can still see it on their website was told I cant speak to a manager. Book with an with a bit of courtesy and honesty and stay away from this lot if you want an easy and stress free      I have had 16 legs with so far this year and cant fault them in any way. Excellent experience, just one short 15 minute delay and the staff are always very friendly and helpful. Long may it continue! :-)     My mom was travelling on the Vancouver-Frankfurt on a long-haul journey with a connection at Frankfurt. The norm would have been a catering service comprising of a main meal and a snack meal (i.e. sandwiches), however it was to her surprise that the crew only served the passengers once. Consider the mere 10 hour journey, its odd to have a catering service of such sort.  Furthermore, the online check-in service was offline and we were not able to check-in mom and choose her desired seat, turning up to the airport and she was allocated with an awkward toilet view for 10 hours, one might find it pleasing but not in our camp. Very much a below par service from the German National carrier. Perhaps our last time with      On the way from Manchester to Mumbai the was bad - cramped seats, undigestable food, non working entertainment, although friendly staff From Mumbai to Manchester the experience and customer service was Fab as soon as we checked in. We were bumped up from economy to Premium class as a surprise! The seats were very comfy and spacious and the food was good. It was also my sisters birthday which was made special with all the crew signing the menu wishing her a Happy Birthday which was another fantastic experience so all in all although the journey was poor on the way to Manchester it was great to see the the can also adapt to providing a fab service.     Dreadful website. Slow at best of times and often not working. Very difficult to contact them. Wont use again.     I didnt know that vegetarian meals were classes as special meals, as every onboard option has meat in it. On the way out, that was my mistake. On the way back to the UK, I made sure to email them, and got a confirmation that my special meal had been ordered.  However, on the  they had no record of this. I just ate bread. I complained to their customer service, who were COMPLETELY obtuse and told me that I had to order a special meal (even though I told them that I had). When I forwarded them emails as proof, they stopped responding to me. Appalling customer service. Will be doing my best to avoid them in the future.     Ive been flying with for many years now and they have always been perfect. And I feel safe with them.     Unexpected and acceptable things you people are doing. I am trying my best in contacting you but of course I am not hearing back from you at all. Im supposed to go tomorrow and fly out to Oslo Sanford airport but after you send me my itinerary it just says Oslo (Oslo) I would like my money back or change my ticket I also insure my ticket and the lady said you didnt at all   Please answer me here     We should never choose this fly-Company, we lost half of our holiday, waiting for our bagage at the final destination, which have been deleyd more then 24hors. Our was 5 hours deleyed aswell.     15 years as senator or frequent flyer flying 750000 miles and you ask for help in the moment of personal tragedy  THEY COULDNT GIVE A SHIT   I will never fly with them again , they are finished     I flied with last summer to Portugal and the whole experience was a pleasure. The staff were really friendly and attentive - and the food was actually really good!   Had no issues, just quality service.     Awesome experience throughout the years.  Great customer service, convenience with the mobile app and awesome business lounges.   If you are frequent flyer you can get a lot of benefits.     does not provide written customer support, so you have to phone a paid number. Not only it that an annoyance, its also a disadvantage for people with special accessibility needs.  Furthermore booking though is usually more expensive than with other airlines, and often less services are offered to passengers booked with  As an example: I booked a via that is operated by Singepore Airways (SQ). SQ wont let me reserve seats because I have a LH number, and LH wont let me reserve seats because the is operated by SQ.     Was on a trip to Malta and all 4 flights were with  All 4 flights were excellent, both with seating space, service and information via SMS. Would book with them first if possible next time.     Good airlines, very nice to travel with them around the world. Last time flew in Spain with them.     Flew with a couple of years ago from Israel to Ireland. There was a delay at the gate and I almost missed my connection  but the attendants and staff were more than patient and courteous, the food on the plane wasnt totally nasty (actually pretty good for plane food) and I feel like it was money well spent. Id probably fly with again on my next trip abroad.     changed my reservation due to changes in schedule. This meant that I was supposed to leave from FRAPORT 3 hours BEFORE I arrived to the airport. After having phoned to LH to explain the problem my back home was missing?? I have now tried to get a response from customer relations since 22.nd of October - through almost 3 weeks. But I am completely ignored! In the end I had to cancel the and buy a new ticket from KLM. I am sorry to say as a old LH customer and frequent flyer - I am giving up. I dont know how LH got the five stars but for sure it was not due to customer relations. I am not going to pay a premium price for the service of a discount company.     Very bad customer service   I had to change something in my reservation which should be possible as long as I do it 24 hours after I made the order.  However Lufthansas communications system was down which meant I couldnt contact them online and the only phone number I could find wasnt open that day.  When it was finally possible to get in contact the 24 hours had past and I was told I could no longer make any change in my order.   I accept the fact that there is a 24 hour limit for changes but then the company should be sure that their channels for communication is working as it should and that it is possible to get in contact.     I just had a brilliant exchange with on TW. They told me - Im not kidding - that due to EU GDPR they are unable to offer excellent customer service any more, both on board and in areas such as after services/customer relations. They have also disabled the functionality of a private message on Facebook and they fail to say why (I assume that because their social media managers were in fact human e-mails who were not replying to complaints on FB in substance but simply providing a customer care e-mail address).  Having said that, I have flown with them for years and have had nothing but excellent service on board.  I simply cannot understand how their customer care on board can be excellent and so unprofessional for after services, such as customer relations and above all their social media people.  It is insulting.     This is the best and friendliest ever! I flew out and in on to Europe and back to the United States. Its how welcoming the attendants make you feel, and the plane itself is very comfortable and always arrives half hour earlier as scheduled time! They care so much for their passengers unlike some rude airlines i would never fly on again, you pay for the price and of course you want to have that service, but definitely deserves every penny of it, and you can never go wrong with them! You dont even have to ask for anything the attendants come by you every hour and ask if you want something to drink. Their food was very delicious and outstanding!! &#128076;&#127996;I will definitely always fly with you again! You been always my favorite  Keep it up  I will definitely keep recommending people to fly with you! Good way to go Germany! &#127465;&#127466; Youre the best in everything!! &#128079;&#127996;     An absolute shambles of an First time and never ever again. Their staff (LHR TERMINAL 2 ) are clueless, arrogant and  they lack empathy . Couldnt believe a German company could be so lackadaisical when it comes to customer service. Our 24 Aug) was delayed then was eventually cancelled; we had to collect our checked in baggage from arrivals. Staff were very brusque in their manner - we had  our nephews  pre-wedding reception to attend that evening but we were told everyones got a wedding. could go on - but no space to write it all.  We were 8 in our party and none of us will ever travel again including the kids and young folks who were with us.  Flights are delayed or cancelled all the time but its how you deal with the aftermath of it all.My advice to is to treat customers with dignity and respect . You need to treat customers  as people and not as money tokens or numbers! Staff need to be well trained, I havent got a glass ball but if things dont change your annual turnover will sooner or later and it wont be in the right direction !     Im not sure about it. Sometimes everything goes smooth and you feel like the king (in the air), but there were times I thought Ill never fly with again. Customer service could be better     Thanks for meet my claim about late delivery of bags, albeit it took quite sometimes, but considering the period, july, has efficiently resolved my dispute keeping up with their commitment to be a customer oriented company     I really hope I m not forced to fly again this   delayed 1 hour and 30 minutes from Heatrow, lost my connection in Frankfurt since it was only 50 minutes, the minimum that the German law allows, but of course you have to change terminals and pass security check again , so even a 10 minutes delay will make you run.  Called support, they said the can put me on a direct , then changed their mind since i already check-in my baggage ...although the plane wasnt even there. So long story short, I had to stay 5 hours in Frankfurt. Used the time to research if I am entitled to compensation.  So I made a request, got rejected because \" a third party contractor made a fault on the aircraft on the previous  Of course I didnt buy it, under EU law, they should have another plane ready if this happen...maintenance of planes is not an excuse. Hired a company to recover the compensation, they took them to court and yes, I got my compensation.  The staff nevertheless, are professional and they offer a nice customer experience on board. Avoid at all costs!     Paid 33% more to travel with compared to Air France as they are the only European to travel to Malabo on a Thursday. Surly lounge receptionists and air stewards. Need to ring the call bell on board to get a drink and breakfast in Business Class. (Sorry to disturb you!) They left my bag in Frankfurt as was overbooked (there was plenty of connection time). Told to expect my bag 4pm same day. Actually received it 5pm next day. Final 1.5 hour arrived 20 minutes late (not bad) but you would think theyd give me the heads-up that my bag didnt make it. Waited 45 minutes for my bag at the carousel for nothing. dont value your time. And this was full fare flex business class! I dread to think how they treat their cattle. That orange \"priority\" label on your bag means nothing. Back to Air France for me. Will make sure I dont rotate on a Thursday in future.     makes sure you dont get tricked by the lofthunsa website,I booked 4 tockets for the economic class from birmingham to Tbilisi and payes over £2000 for the tickets , however when we got to the airport they told us that u have to pay for your logage because aparenly we had to choose which type of economic class we neede and as default it was set on economic light and i was unable to see the option becuse it was hidden , we ebde up paying over £200 for our logage which is absolooutly ridicilous and day light robbery to me .     Customer Service number  0371 945 9747 gets redirected to a 0871 number which cost 10p minute. They make you wait so that your phone bill goes up by the minute playing music. If you need to speak to them urgently then you will end up with a large telephone bill as 0871 numbers are not included in most tariff. Suddenly overnight are not sending boarding passes once you have successfully checked in online for no apparent reason     Could not get a simple answer of how large a pram could be before it wasnt free to take on board.  Got 3 separate answers from 3 people all of which couldnt send a confirmation of their answer.  One of the service agents did not know that Hamburg was in Germany.  If someone works for  they probably should know the second largest city in Germany.  It is clear that no longer cares for their customers.     I book a  but after same month they change the time to 6 hour later. (then i cant catch my ship now) i use the candle and refund on they website. but i still not get the money. on the website they say 2-3 day. nog i has want 9 day. and still not see any money     If you have to fly, then fly  Great services     I recently had to travel whilst 7 months pregnant and was apprehensive and anxious ahead of the journey. To counter this I had done everything possible to make the journey comfortable in advance such as paying for extra to reserve a comfortable aisle seat in advance with  Upon boarding my seat was taken, with no explanation. I ended up having to sit  in a very uncomfortable seat and it was an unpleasant journey. It took a long time to receive a response from my complaint to customer services and it was devoid of understanding, empathy or apology for what had happened. I will never travel with Luftansa again and recommend pregnant travellers to steer clear.     A great way to fly. Awesome staff, outstanding service. Best      Ive been flown many times and every time was satisfied.     Never had a problem flying with ..Actually I found them very helpful and straight forward. Yeah probably not much smiling and on but they do their job well and fast and thats all I need. Im an adult and  I dont need customer service talking to me as Im mentally disabled...( found quiet a lot on many airlines and asia)or \"lick my boots\". It would make me feel rather uncomfortable than happy...Im flying-they do their job :)     I had some great experiences with the overall company, i lost my phone in the plane and it was brought to my next transit with a great help from the service desk. I injured myself during my vacation and when i came upon check-in i was asked - without any proof  - if i would like some assistance i got a wheelchair and some great helpers !  It´s just sad when i return home i notice that my next with Eurowings(which is also  is cancelled... Therefore the \"great\" reveiw...  We had booked a 4 months ago and then it is cancelled.. Call center is like... the worst ever... I had to book another company to be there on time...     Very poor customer service level. However they have some great destinations.     My first impression of was one of a giant in the commercial aviation industry. A firm that in no way compares to the likes of Wizzair and Ryanair. A company, that not only cares about their customers, but aim at achieving high quality customer service for EVERY customer. My goodness, was I wrong! My experience with started on February 5th with my connecting from Lviv to London Heathrow. Onboard the cabin crew and the seats were to a more than satisfactory level. However, that is where it stopped. The food provided was less than pleasing with a choice of a cheese sandwich or a beef sandwich, followed up by a cheap little candy bar. Then again, what can you expect from airlines nowadays? A fairly average experience so far, that is until we landed. Once I went through security and border control, my baggage was nowhere to be seen. After searching the airport proximity/waiting for 45 minutes I approached one of the lost baggage staff. A lady which instructed me to go on another circle of the airport before I fill in the lost baggage form. Which I did consequently, finding nothing (surprise-surprise). Once I started filling in the form I stated to her, that I have pictures of the baggage, surely this would aid the people in its search? To which I received a reply of: \"Its not important right now.\" So I went home disappointed with all my essentials in my bag. Next day I had work, which I couldnt attend as my shirts, blazer and overcoat were all in my bag. After work I contacted to ask if they had any update and to state the importance of the situation. No progress had been made, the lady I spoke with asked me if I had any pictures of the bag. Which I sent to her the same evening. Basically understanding, that if I had not made the effort, the company would not have either. Long story short... After 3 days I receive a call from somebody in Germany telling me exactly what was in my bag (They opened it, without permission). Although this is a basic breach of privacy, I didnt care at the time, as I just wanted my bag back. The company they work with Citybagsluggage are an even bigger joy to interact with than  They do not change delivery times or address and give you a delivery time only 30 minutes before the actual delivery takes place (2 hour window as they put it). To top things off, on one day they forgot that my baggage needs to be delivered and on the other they \"could not find the address\" - hilarious. It took them 3 days to deliver my baggage, which arrived dirty and scratched. (Pictures attached) Topping off an already amazing customer experience. For me, once a customer has already been put through a terrible customer experience, which the firm is fully responsible for, no expense should be spared to compensate the customer. Not with Lufhtansa apparently. I have contacted them 6 days ago to share my experience and still I have not received a reply! An absolute joke of a company!     I could not find a with my family with the bonus miles     changed my booking and I just had to accept it according to them. I talked to their customer service and they told me that they can do any changes they want. Their only obligations is to inform me about the changes. I will never choose in the future.     My wife and I flew from London Heathrow to Bangkok, via Frankfurt on the 13th December 2017.&#160; We booked specific seats on the Frankfurt to Bangkok (LH772).&#160; When we booked the seats (76H and 76J) it was clear from the diagram of the plan layout that the seats we booked were exit seats with extra leg room.&#160; However, the actual seats had no extra leg room at all.&#160; We feel we were mis-sold these seats.&#160; Had normal seats been suitable for both of us then we would not have paid extra for specific ones.  &#160;  I am 63\" tall and have type 1 diabetes.&#160; I also have Klinefelters syndrome which means that my legs are extra long in proportion to my height.&#160; I struggle to physically fit in standard seats.&#160; I also have pain in my knees related to Klinefelters syndrome and the loss of bone density it causes.  &#160;  I spoke to a steward immediately on boarding but was informed there was nothing he could do as the was fully booked.&#160; He did acknowledge that customers regularly complain about these seats not being the same as the online seating plan.&#160; He indicated hed give us vouchers as compensation but they never appeared.  &#160;  When the passenger in front of me reclined his seat I was stuck in mine.&#160; I could not move as my knees were jammed against the seat in front.&#160; After an exchange with both the other passenger and the steward, the purser offered me a crew seat at the back of the plane which I was happy to accept as they had more leg room.&#160; However, as it had no arm rests and are not designed for comfort, it was not possible for me to sleep in it.&#160; I had to lie down on the floor and a stewardess kindly gave me extra blankets.&#160; My wife had to remain in the standard, mid-row seat.  &#160;  I have booked similar seats for the return on the 9th January (LH773, 76B and 76C) and as you can see from the attached screenshot taken from your website, it appears as if I have again booked seats with extra leg room.&#160; Will I get the extra leg room indicated on the seating plan or will the actual seats by laid out as they were on the outward   &#160;  I cannot endure a long haul in which I cannot move in my seat.&#160; Please can you arrange for us to have seats on our return which meet my expectations and requirements, and for which we have paid.   I booked seats for my wife and I well in advance and paid a premium for seats that I understood would meet my requirements.&#160; In mis-selling these seats as having extra room has fallen well below my expectations of a 5-star   Sent this email complaint on 28 Dec 2017 so far not had any response. Feedback ID 31516019.     Traveled with and they smashed my childs car seat.  They only offered a fraction of the value of the seat as it \"depreciates\" in value over time.  Lufhansa child seats are used for a fixed period of time i.e. 2-3 years at which point they have zero resale value as purchasing seats second hand is unsafe.  They are not like normal luggage should not be treated as such.  I dont see why I should be left out of pocket because you were careless.Terrible customer service.     was on time and friendly staff inside the plane.  Thanks, I got home safe.     If the Fuhrer was still alive, hed probably fly      I flew with to Europe and back to the USA. I chose it cause it considered to be a respectful company, What I got? Both flights were delayed, worse food ever, tiny seats, and which is the most interesting part they lost my luggage.... thanks god they delivered it same day... at 3 AM!!!!! I ll never fly by that ..     Was promised, through email,  to be called for reply on a matter with - no one has called yes. It was i July. Has been emailing them almost every Monday since then - still no reply. I guess they dont care about their customers - and from trustpilot I can see Im not the only feeling like this.     Another experience with this company and was very pleased with it. Apart from delay, all went well and nice. The staff on board was lovely, really nice and helpful.     Worth it. So worth it. Not just for the efficiency and the service but the competency of staff. I have remarked that most of the staff have a decent knowledge of multiple languages which makes every step of communication so much more clear and fluid.  Sometimes you are have travelled from the ends of earth, most likely missing a few vital hours of sleep and you just want to be understood! I feel can rely on this constant level of professionalism.     system hacked... 435.000 Miles stolen from my account... is doing NOTHING! Worst customer service ever!!     Often Delayed, but services  is quiet good, would still recommend. (excluding the ques caused by cancelled flights)     Good afternoon,  On 12/09/2016 booked a two-way ticket trip to Riga (with a layover in Frankfurt) from lisbon for the weekend 25 to 27 of November of the same year. Check my flights details on the attached file.  The reason for this weekend was to celebrate the birthday of one of my best friends and to attend a Wine tasting event in Riga (this last one wasnt cheap at all and was kinda unique). The wine tasting event was already reembursed but the opportunity is lost, the birthday of my friend is kinda priceless.  already reembursed through edreams the value paid for the  just waiting for the reembursement for the luggage add-on. This issue is getting sorted out.  What I find strange, is after 5 months still havent received any news about my compensation fee for my cancelled  not only I went to the airport on the day in question at 4:30am, stayed over there waiting until a solution was sorted out (any was found), on the same day went 2 more times to the airport to complain again at the counter, and the assistant stated (at the 2nd time) that my complaint was officially issued.  Already called loads of times to numbers with no success, and the first 5minutes are is deutsch until the same message is reported in english, which makes it impossible for you to hang up the phonecall until they switch to english (to actually understand what is the message), therefore you end up paying huges phone fees.  So basically Im complaying through this service, to see if I get a faster reply from  I got my weekend ruined so Im only demanding which is rightfully mine.

I chose Luftansa because its a german company and I thought...It might be good. First of all the seats of the plane are tiny, similar to easy jet, considering I spend over 12 hours there it was a nightmare flying with them.  Food was disgusting, truly disgusting. Cabin crew did a great job, they offered drinks during the whole so nothing to say about them other than Thanks  My was cancelled because of technical issues, I put a complaint and they replied saying that according to the european bla bla bla I was not supposed to get a compensation because it was a technical issue. That european law says that if the is cancelled because of a companyissue, then I have to get a compensation... So I replied telling them about that so they decided to pay me. But their first answer was..Sorry!   Honestly, I would never fly with them again, but mainly because of the size of their flights     I called them before my and asked how many baggages that I was allowed to check in for my international  There was a campaign and I was told that I can check in two baggages for free.   During check-in they charged me for the second baggage. Thank you      Long haul from Canada to Manchester, they put me on an earlier connection - efficient, professional and kind.     I was due to fly from Hong Kong to Frankfurt at the end of November, but due to the strike my was cancelled, I could not get the link to the website to work, logging into my booking did nothing, so I had to phone them to re-book my  so of course after sitting on hold for hour and half I had an expensive phone bill to face. I was meant to be flying Premium Economy, as a special treat, but ended up having to fly economy. I was promised a refund in the difference and compensation. So I email Customer relations and get given an ID number, but that is it. Now over 6 weeks later I have heard NOTHING, just the odd pathetic response on Facebook from them, telling me to keep waiting, its unbelievable that they cant get these things sorted, basically they are stealing my money, if I owed them money they would be very quick to collect!!!!! PLEASE NO ONE GO NEAR      So it has been one of those situations with this so called reputable that has really frustrated me and disappointed me substantially.  To start off with I work in the travel industry and deal regularly with high profile customers and have dealt with many airlines in the past who have been more than helpful on many occasions.   So about a week ago, following the Istanbul attacks, I contacted them to query whether there was a waiver policy in place to which I was just given a \"no\", and it was left at that.    I left it at this, and then after discussion with friends we decided we were going to extend our stay in Turkey for an extra day, so today I accidentally rebooked a different which then caused my initial confirmed to be married up &#8211; employs this \"married segment control\" which is a pain in the rear end both to us travel agents, and travellers.    Thinking that they would help out a colleague, I approached them and explained my situation, but was just responded to with a \"no\".    To start with, they dont offer any special rates to agents, so for me to travel in a combination of premium economy and business class it already set me back over $4100.  On top of this, I would be paying them $270 in change fees which Im more than happy to do, but they just refuse to assist.   It annoys me, because this was not the only option available to me for the country I am visiting, and they just dont seem to be of any use to anyone (whether youre in the industry or not).    This is not the first, but it is definitely going to be last, that I fly with them, and I will certainly referring my clients to alternate carriers in the future!     I booked myself and my 30kg Labrador to travel from Dublin to Venice via Frankfurt on Dec 1st. I found the whole process regarding booking the animal on very easy. Customer service agents in Italy were fantastically informative in relation to everything I needed to travel with my pet. I got to Dublin airport on the day of travel and was so lucky to be helped by staff member Rebecca. She was standing at the business class desk and although I was travelling economy she couldnt do enough for me. I was trying to deal with my luggage, and my dog and his crate , traveling with my pet for the first time I was extremely flustered. She brought me to exactly where I needed to be ensuring that we were checked in and everything was done correctly. She was so friendly and so professional and everything ran smoothly from Dublin to Venice. Rebecca really helped me alot in Dublin and I am so thankful to her for making that day a little easier, it really meant alot.  I will recommend for animal transportation and I will definitely use them in the future based on that experience.  I had one issue regarding my dogs crate but am unsure where on our route that it happened. Two of the wheels were broken on arrival in Venice which is a shame as they just slide off so there was no reason that enough force to break them would have been used. I did offer to take them off at Dublin airport but was told the lads bringing the crate to the aircraft would do it.  Next time I will take them off myself.  A fantastic overall experience though mostly due to the kindness and professionalism of the staff members at Dublin airport particularly Rebecca.     I want to thank for their honesty about refunding my ticket ( minus the file costs, that I think it s normal.)     I am very satisfied with the service. I am a little disappointed with the 8 kg rule for the hand luggage, because you cannot possibly fit all important and valuable stuff inside :(     HON member since 6 years. Service level continuously deteriorating. Although receiving nice marketing letters on fine business paper with all sorts of promises, the reality is unfortunately very different.  Latest scoop: as HON member, you have a personal contact person with email and phone number at your disposition. Problem: they dont call you back once you have an issue to be solved!   Absurd (and sad) how treats their highest spending and most frequent travelling customers!     My first trip to the US was a great one, and it all began and ended with great flights.  I flew premium economy, and I was very pleased.  Great seats, great food, and great staff!  Smiling faces and friendly service!   Ill fly again in the future!     Travel with them for 3 of my holidays and had a good experience. No delays, smooth landing. food isnt the best but was ok.     They changed the time of a I had booked and the new time didnt suit me and was also offered a refund.  Asked for the refund about 3 months ago but all I keep getting is automated emails telling me how sorry they are that they cant answer my question and could I phone their help centre?  So I phoned the help centre (more than once) and was told the refund was on its way........ but theres still no sign of it.  Would never use them again - not what I expect from a reputable company.     So far so good. Travelling in econony class i excpect no wonders.   Staff is nice. Food is eatable. Entertainment avalable. Chairs are not inclinig as much as wished but then again, add some dollars or live with it.  Had a delay on my last but captain must have made a shortcut and we arrived in time in Frankfurt. The connection went easy. You could read it on your screen and also in the speakers they told us the gates of all connections. Next was also delayed but again the captain made us land before arrivaltime.     is one of the few airlines where you can have your pets in your cabin instead of the cargo .  I have only experienced Super good service and this applies to both the staff on the phones and those who are at the airport and the staff on the planes.  Many thanks to that it is possible to bring my new puppy..  I will allways fly with when it is possible.  Best wishes  Christian Montesinos Denmark     I tried to purchase a ticket online but was unable to do so. I thought there was an error with my credit card but a call to my issuer let me know that that wasnt the case, and that it was OK to conduct international transaction, and all was alright. I tried purchasing a few more times and to my disappointment, only the error message came out. Called the number once but did not work. I gave up and purchased on another site. I hope you have alternatives to your payment method, like PayPal so you can better facilitate your customers with an easy purchase experience.     Actually, super happy long term LH customer. Kind of bummed by all the negative feedback here.     My from Munich to Manchester was cancelled as I was on my way to the airport. Tried doing the rebooking online and it told me to ring up....what good that did me! Couldnt get through to anyone!  Had to book my own hotel, my own back home and sort out my own transport! THEY LEFT ME STRANDED!!  Ive tried to claim for a refund for all of my costs and from reading about other peoples experiences it looks like that wont be happening. Ive even tried to get a refund online and they wont even let me do that. And once again im getting thrown pillar to post because they dont want to pay out what they are LEGALLY required to pay out by European Aviation Law!!!. I am not being out of pocket for their sheer negligence of their customers.  I sincerely hope that someone from does read this as I hope I finally get a response in a reasonable time!  MY FIRST AND LAST EXPERIENCE WITH  NEVER FLYING WITH THIS TERRIBLE EVER AGAIN!!!     Nice every time we fly with them.     For hours this message. Unfortunately we cannot process your enquiry at the moment due to technical reasons.  Good to know you are that rich you no longer need customers !     While flying back to South Africa from Amsterdam through to Frankfurt and then SA. They announced and asked that if anyone does not need to urgently get to Frankfurt they offer their seats up as the plane is overbooked. Since my wife and I had a 10 hour lay over in Frankfurt we happily put our hands up. We found out that per ticket they will give us 250 euros, I asked if I could get it transfered into my account, they said I could do so in South Africa at the office   Upon landing I immediately went to the office, I gave all my details and was out of there in 20 minutes. That was almost three weeks ago and after numerous emails, I still do not know when that money will be giving to me.  Furthermore, I lost air miles for both my ticket and my wifes ticket between the Amsterdam and Frankfurt   I really enjoyed all flights with  I am just not enjoying the service there after!     We were doing a long haul to the Far East. We saw the advert to upgrade to PREMIUM ECOMONY  and paid an extra 600 euros each to upgrade,   We were promised lots of extras like extra legroom, food served on china, amenity kit etc  The truth is WE GOT NOTHING. Zilch, Zero. Just the normal rubbish service, standard economy seat, no choice of food and that was served in paper cups and tin foil. No IFE at all as it wasnt working.   And when we asked for a refund of the extra we paid for the upgrade- they just ignored us. After nine emails, we finally got an email just laughing at us and saying tough,   See you guys in Court,   TRADING STANDARDS and the ADVERTISING STANDARDS are both carrying out a formal investigation into this company. Lets hope that the UK CAA finally do remove their route licences.     I had a two leg long haul where the first leg was delayed due to weather, so would miss the onward transfer.  Before boarding, i asked the transfer desk staff if there were any other flights they could transfer me to and was told no. I think they were just too busy to want to look.  I phoned Lufthansas booking help line and explained my situation, they were extremely helpful. After a bit of searching, they found a seat on another  so handing my phone back to the transfer desk staff, between them, they offloaded me and got me transferred to the final seat on a direct not in the Star Alliance Group, it was even a seat upgrade! I had to travel without my hold bag but it was on the next and delivered to my hotel 16 hours after I arrived!  The return flights were all on time, and the stewards/stewardesses on my A380 were exceptional, very polite, helpful and gave a great service.  Finally, before you go thinking this was all done because of the class I flew, I was only in Economy.  I cant praise them enough, thank you      I took Lufhtansa from Paris to Miami. Very good service and on time.     From all the airlines one of the best! They are reeeeaally trying to give a perfect customerservice. One of the best from all the airlines which I know. Thank you so much ! The callcenter agents are so helpful!  I will keep flying with u guys!! Thx again     is a reliable and very good compagny, i did not give 5/5 because things can still be improved (sometimes delay but rare)     Everything was fine, the staff is kind, smiling and with sense of humour! I would travel with them again any time and recommend them to my family and friends!     As an company, has above average standards. Their Miles and More program is affiliated with so many major airlines that you can use their miles for almost any route. However, it is best to purchase their flights from other booking sites like Kayak or Orbitz, because the fares on com are always higher, even for the same      2 months ago my wife and I endured our worst travel experiences EVER, travelling from Buenos Aires to Florence, with stopover in Frankfurt.  Late arrivals led to frantic running through the entire Frankfurt Airport.... 5 kilometers... more late arrivals meant overnight stay in Frankfurt airport, no staff available for guidance or support, ignorance EVERYWHERE.  They do have a website where you can write a detailed report over what happened, and they say they really want your feedback... but after 2 months and several reminders, I am now here on Trustpilot and all other social medias to warn you good people out there to stay far far far far away from that company.  I have also written directly to their Management, which is first name and a dot, and last name then @dlh.de. so f.i. their CEO´s email is  Christoph.Franz@dlh.de  Good luck  Leslie Cameron  I have absolutely no illusions that this will work, but I have to try.     Have been flying with on and off for years now and have once again booked with them for my flights in a few months to Delhi in India. Their service has been excellent in terms of my experiences and no one comes close yet. Definitely recommended.     My boyfriend and I booked an evening from Amsterdam to Berlin(direct) with  departing around 21:00. This was deliberate so we could enjoy a final day in Amsterdam before departing to our next stop.   Now we have been switched to a which departs at 13:45 and includes a 50 minute stopover in Frankfurt, effectively taking an entire day off our trip as we cant use the day for anything when we depart so early. It would have been ok  had the time only changed by an hour or so, but several hours and a stopover for a that should take about an hour is a big leap.    To give some credit, they did say we should be entitled to a refund. My boyfriend said the customer service was good when he called them up. Sadly we cannot get our refunded because we didnt book directly through  and the travel agency we booked with wont allow it.     After several flights with I was ordering a for three persons to the US. After the quite long order process theres an error, when I try to pay. I call to their support as prompted. They tell me to start over as its a common problem, when Im signed in to their system (which must be very irritating for their loyal costumers). I do, but when Im about to place the order, the price has gone 168 EUR up. I call again and the agent promises to refund the 168 EUR if I just place the order. If he had not told me this I would have gone with British Airlines instead, which also is a four-star and was cheaper to begin with. Some weeks after Ive sent my e-mail I hear nothing from  So I try to contact them by mail. Here I get standard answers with rude remarks. After I tell them that Ill pass it on to my lawyers, they promise to forward the case to the right department (why not do this at once instead of after 4 e-mails?). Weeks after this I receive a letter telling me about how they price their tickets and that they will not refund anything - no discussion. Furthermore they choice to place a man weighing no less than 150 kg besides me on my 11 hour  which took up half of my seat. This is not the passengers fault, but so large people should have two seats so they dont take up other passengers room. Well, thanks a lot  well never meet again.     Have flown to Dublin from Denmark via Frankfurt. It all went according to plan, no delays and their service was impeccable. Even free snacks and beverages on the plane was a part of the experience.  So all thumbs up from me - would for sure fly with the again     Flights are always clean, service efficient and the catering offering in Europe one of the better ones.  The hot wraps are really tasty. Unless you get a cheap deal prices can sky rocket, and lack of a business lounge at major airports like Heathrow loses them a star.     I flew with 4 times already, two times short and two times long distance. The long distance was awesome: excellent service, nice & experienced staff, great Media Centre with lots of movies to pick. The short distance flights were both delayed and the boarding was very weird, at first I thought wow this is superquick but then everybody was cramped in the dark tunnel in front of the plane and standing around for at least 15 minutes instead of still staying in the boarding hall and doing it properly, with back seats first and so on. I have mixed feelings about this  I would need to fly with it again to see in which direction it is going. But unfortunately most of the times its a very pricey option, although they land at the most convenient airports. Lets see!     Good deals, they were always cheaper than other companies, if the price is what youre after.     I had a horrible experience with BUDGETAIR (Forget about this outfit) with a booking they made on  was not only able to solve the problems created by BudgetAir, but were extremely cooperative in finding solutions. Maria at the Cyprus office was especially \"professional\" and caring. She followed-up with me as promised and delivered  on a complicated re-booking of a to Canada with a very modest change fare charge, while the outfit known as BudgetAir tried to rip-me-off for almost 5 times the cost. Deal directly with because you will be assured of a professional staff and a company that values reputation / customer service.     I dont understand why has such a bad rating! I never actually got on one of their planes so I dont know anything about that part. I only know that their customer service is excellent! I booked a ticket to Caracas 1 month ago with departure in April, but then a few weeks later I got a new job and was unable to go because of some vacation rules. I called customer service and they gave me all my money back!     has only profit in mind, people and health dont count     I booked to fly from UK to Frankfurt via Dusseldorf for a sporting event.  The event was changed to Dusseldorf so I called to cancel the last leg of the journey only to be told by a South African woman that I couldnt do that and needed to buy a whole new ticket.  I ended up on the plane with two seats going to the same place.  Thanks for nothing   Terrible customer service but the was good.  I now loathe to use them again.     I flew to South Africa in May on Lufthansas flagship A-380 on economy. There is a definite feeling of being made to feel that you are in economy on this  On the super jumbo my entertainment system did not work. The staff were not particularly concerned. On the way back the entire section of the aircrafts entertainment system did not work. They offered alternative seats elsewhere about 2 hours into the but no isle or upgrades so I stayed in my seat. So no movies etc. They said to write and complain. I did. I got an automated reply that they were busy. Its been two months now and they never got back to me. Clearly is a mediocre  not a top one. In general its an for the staff and one gets the impression that although attentive, there is plenty room for improvement in service standards. How about trying to get back on all customers complaints within 7 days! Surely this is possible. They serve nothing but pretzels as a snack between meals. Again the feeling of \"you are in economy - get used to it\" etc etc. Its clearly deliberate. I will try another next time if I can. Just an all round mediocre experience. Shame. Such potential.     concerining the service and the punctuality, there are better airlines'"

       "'    Totally unhelpful woman on the phone. For the first time I have received that bad service on their site. She did not want at all listen my viewpoint.  Even in a period of crisis you need to be respectful. I do not know why those people do this kind of work if they can not offer the basic rules of communication. Too bad.     Unbelievably difficult to contact and totally unhelpful website even worse Australian contacts. Their complaints number is even disconnected, we will never use this again. Terrible service from what was once a good      Like hundreds of people my flights were cancelled by the in Mid April so I rang to request a refund (this should be automatic but...) the agent offered a voucher which I declined as the event I was to travel for is cancelled and will not be refixed for a later date.I was told it would take a number of weeks to process which is against the EU directive which they know, but do not care about.  After a month I rang and was told by an agent that my refund was processed and I would have my money in the next week. Sounds great, thanks etc. BUT...  One week later no money, so I rang again, this time the agent I spoke to tells me that my claim has not been processed and cannot give me a date when it would be. I asked why I had been given a completely different story one week previous, he could not answer. The second agent was polite and apologised etc. and did not make any false promises (he was as professional as anyone trying to defend a poor situation could be)  claim the Covid 19 has reduced activity and this is causing delays, however they have surplus staff in other areas who are not being redeployed to make refunds, the technology exists to enable remote working, so limits in offices due to social distance etc. does not apply and is an invalid defense. If I can book and pay for a online, then the can reverse the transaction online just as quickly if they choose to do so.  In my opinion as a company have chosen to limit the number of refunds they pay out so that they can use customers funds for cash flow purposes. This is a deliberate illegal ploy and yet the EU commission do nothing. Retaining money that you have no right to is theft as far as I am concerned.  Do not use this  they take your money and lie to you.     Worst ever. Refuses to refund. Cancels flights and rebooks you to the day after without notification.     See judgement in County Court G5QZ25E2 Pearce v obtained on Monday for refunds on three cancelled flights under article 8(1a) of EC261/2004. I also got costs and interest at 8% on my money from the date at which I paid for the tickets (October 2019). I used moneyclaimonline. I am now getting bailiff order. It is straightforward. There is certainly no need to be lawyer, or use any commission agent.  Arguably the withholding of refunds amounts to an appropriation under the Theft Acts. Therefore as soon as the local magistrates court opens, I will be taking a private prosecution for corporate theft. The law that permits private prosecutions is section 6 of the Prosecution of Offenders Act. This routeway is open to anyone for contracts made in UK. engaged a solicitor to defend themselves against me at their expense to no avail. If enough people take this route, will find their policy of unlawfully withholding refunds too expensive.     They refuse to refund our money for ticketa that they cancelled     to Istanbul cancelled. Fine. Told online that there is no refund but can rebook. Cant rebook online. Must phone. told that would be answered inside 15 minutes. 70 minutes later still no answer. Dont even provide baroque music while they leave you dangling at the end of the line. Have now given up for the moment. Must be the most incompetent in the world.     To start off with, I think the support staff is probably the UNFRIENDLIEST BUNCH OF FCKN C*NTS THAT IVE EVER SPOKE WITH!!! Unhelpful, rude and definitely NOT willing to assist with my boarding pass issues! They always just hang up or go \"sorry the connection is bad hence were hanging up\". THIS IS NO WAY TO TREAT YOUR CUSTOMERS, AND ESPECIALLY NOT IF I BOOKED A BUSINESS FARE YOU UNFRIENDLY CROOKS!!! Furthermore their business class offer is just awful, lounges closed, food not even close to being decent, only one option to choose from. If you have the chance, DONT FLY !! I hope these c*nts go bankrupt!     Simply criminal, Cancelled flights promised refunds... Two months later nothing but more news of them threatening bankruptcy to avoid bailout conditions. Support teams continue to use half truths to try fool customers into thinking refunds are coming, clearly nothing is getting processed. Avoid at all costs     I cancelled 3 flights on March 18, 2020 from the US to Munich.  When I didnt receive my refund after 10 days I called the customer service line and they said that their \"accounting\" department was taking 6-8 weeks to process refunds and to check back on May 3rd.  I called on May 4, 2020 and got the same lip service...my refunds were in queue but they could not (would not) provide any date of when my refund would be processed.  Shame on YOU   Your website states that you will refund within 7 days if purchased on a credit card so you are violating your own policy.  NEVER fly      Shame on  I never again use this scam of service.  I bought a ticket for Frankfurt to Stockholm during the Coronavirus outbreak.   Of course, I cant during those periods of time and ask for a refund.  I live in Asia and they only process a refund if you call the Germany HQ. What kind of joke is that I understand I bought economy light fare which means the cheapest class. But, come on how you racists with your service? And do you expect me to call internationally with no time frame of refund and any transparent explanation? BS with your service.   I look at twitter many people complaining about talking on the phone 30-45min without any solid solution. Do you expect me to pay how expensive is an international call? Meh...Totally disappointed with called 5-stars airlines the same level with LCC.   I am using other airlines from Asia to Europe to give me a lot of easy ways to refund my instead of calling directly.  It is 2020 and we cant process online via email or something? Is doesnt have computers or the internet?  Maybe you should put a banner no refund for economy light fare ticket, instead urge your customer chasing you.   Let me tell you, YOU SHOULD ASK FOR FOREIGN CUSTOMERS TO COME TO GERMANY AND FILL FORM FOR REFUND POLICY.  Why you dont refund automatically unless somebody calls or fill online rebooking form?   -10.000 VALUE FOR      All companies are struggling during COVID-19 but dont try and cheat your customers! My had been cancelled and I wanted a refund. tried to offer me a voucher but when I said I wanted my 600 euros back they told me that was not possible as I had already cancelled my online. After some emailing back and forth where they said my case has been closed and there was nothing to do, I had to threaten to take this further as they were cheating me and I asked for proof that could show I cancelled and their confirmation showing that I had cancelled. Of course they could not provide me with that (as there was no such thing) and suddenly I was allegeable to get a refund. Still waiting for the money though.     Absolutely the worst in the world. Ive planned to fly with them for the first time as I normally choose cheap airlines like Ryanair and easyJet. My flights were cancelled without any communication, if I wasnt tracking them myself I wouldnt even know. Ive emailed them on 15th of March requesting refund as getting through to their service centre is impossible. Ive not received a response so I decided to stay up and called them at 2am to get through - lady said it will take UP to a month to receive a refund, that was end of March. Today they have responded to the email from 15th of March, pretty unaware of my call and cancellation over the phone and told me to wait another 3-4 weeks for a refund but they cant give any proper timeframes. I really cant get my head around how they are treating customers and the fact theyre prioritising rebookings because that still gives them money. They dont understand that people have lost their jobs or been furloughed and need money now, not in two months time. Its unacceptable. The fact that you also have to call them rather than being able to rebook or cancel via their website shows how backwards they are too. Their customer service on Facebook are robotic, they dont even read properly what you write, just copy and paste same answer for everybody. In comparison, easyjet, a cheap  have been much better in regards to technology and customer service. I hope theyll go into administration once everything is over.     I spoke to a very pleasant customer service advisor from and was  told I would be refunded my money after they cancelled my  Since then I have heard nothing other than an email offering vouchers. I dont want vouchers,  I wont accept them and you need to give me back my money. This behaviour is not on.  Get it sorted now  I shouldnt be helping you to stay afloat.      I paid for a service which you cancelled. I and others are legally entitled to a full refund. Why are you ignoring your legal obligations and not giving your customers the refund they are entitled too. Other airlines are!     and corona; Ethics, profit and morale  All of us are in a very difficult health crisis. Besides very serious corona cases, citizens are limited by emergency measures, and the economy is facing an unprecedented challenge. In such a case, everybody expects civilized solutions when disputes occur.  I am since 1987 Frequent Traveler and Senator with  I flew more than 3 million of miles over the years. I stayed during the critical week between March 6 and 12, 2020 in New York. I have regularly consulted the Web pages of important airlines. Starting March 9, US airlines, like American, Delta and United, offered free-of-change rebooking for domestic and international flights. has waited. March 12, 2020, President Trump announced a traveling ban from/to Europe. I immediately tried to contact  The US phones lines were not operating that day. After 40 minutes, I could reach a Frankfurt phone number. I asked for rebooking from March 24 to March 12, 2020. Seats were available in all classes. I have meet the criteria of free-of-charge rebooking (published on the official Web page March 12, 2020): - I have booked before March 5, 2020 - Departing was before April 30, 2020  The agent forced me into a booking change, and charged 1,124.22 EUR with the result that the price of the one-way-ticket of 1,900.00 EUR for economy class. The LH413 to Munich on March 12, 2020 was half-empty in all classes. I have written a letter to Mr. Spohr, CEO of  he delegated my case to Customer Relations. 3 weeks of correspondence between us ended with no results. They have missed the point to respond to free-of-charge rebooking. Instead, they have mentioned items that did not apply, e.g. mentioning an upgrade that seated me next to the restroom in economy class. Customer Relations has never tried to reach a mutually agreeable settlement.  In comparison with US airlines, gave a very bad response to the situation. They utilized the short time window to cash-in from concerned customers. operates a very powerful department for ticket price optimization. I call this procedure: orchestrated wrongdoing.  Taking a financial advantage of concerned travelers in a last minute action for profit? It is cheap! I miss business ethics and morale.  Dr. Kornel Terplan     My was canceled, I used the refund option online but did not work. Tried to contact customer service , after several tries and + 8 hours on hold the refund was requested. They told me 1 week. After 1 week nothing so I called them again and then they said 3 weeks.  After 3 weeks I called them again and now they say 6-8 weeks. They are thieves, people should NOT fly with any more!!! They will steal your money. Now i will wait for few more weeks then i will call my creditcard company to get back my money.  Once again will scam you, be warned.     has the worst customer support Ive ever experienced. I asked a receipt for my last travel. Legally, has to generate the receipt if handles their taxing correctly. I asked the customer service to send me the receipt via email twice. They replied me twice that I should call the customer service by phone (why cant they just send it to me via email, itd take shorter to send it to me than spending time to write reply)..  I called the customer service, it took 30 minutes someone to pick it up. I talked to a lady who didnt have an understandable English. She told me that they will send the receipt in a day. After a week later, I called the customer service again, This time it took more than 50 minutes and someone picked up the phone but didnt talk. It was very annoying to waste that much time.. Then I went to Lufthansas webpage to fill in the feedback form. I spent 15 minutes to describe how bad they are handling a simple process, especially generating receipt per purchase is something they have to do legally, not something nice to do. So guess what happened? Their web forum didnt send the message and gave an error message. Its totally a joke company how each single process of their customer service is badly designed. If someone wanted to design the worst customer service on purpose, would be a good example.  I dont need to state that my connection were delayed and I barely made to my connection  Each airlines may have delays, but how the customer service works terrible is too amateurish.     *DO NOT GIVE YOUR BANK DETAILS TO  Use a credit card if you book with them, so you have more protection. I made a booking about a month ago to travel in December, it was an expensive one of nearly €2000. About a week later, I noticed that the charge had been applied to my account twice, causing the direct debit for my mortgage to be rejected. I rang customer service (it was really hard to find a number for them, if youre in Ireland, ring 01-5339956). They said they could only see one charge, and told me to ring my bank. I did, and they suggested that I wait a few days to see if the charge would disappear. I did, and no such thing happened, my €2000 still missing for far over a week after I had done the booking. I had a number of calls to customer service following this, not helpful at all, they didnt seem to have access to any more info than what I had in my booking email. They had no phone numbers for their Accounts dept. or anything like that, and no email address I could use. I eventually filled out a form online, and a few days later the charge was removed. I googled this, and several people have had this issue with  the advice is to use a credit card to avoid this. Very unprofessional, shouldnt be necessary, tickets can be very expensive, and something like this can cause people a lot of problems financially. Now Im wondering what it will be like flying with them, after starting off on the wrong foot like this. Last time I flew with was about 15 years ago, I remember being very happy with them then, so hopefully this incident will not be representative of the trip ahead. Charging customer €4000 instead of €2000 is a very serious problem, and not solving it in a timely manner makes it even worse.     They are breaking the law by not giving refunds. Its not just the that got hit by the coronavirus crisis, everybody was. There are so many people who lost their jobs and have thousands of euros stuck in that company which they can use right now. How silly of us to think that a huge company like would keep its obligations and follow the EU regulations. 7 days is the time frame for refunds in case of cancelled flights according to EU law. Its been a month now and I dont even know if I will be getting my money back. No customer service, no confirmation that a refund is on its way. Just nothing.     I had very bad experience with flights they are the most thieving people and they or not organized with their work especially with the seating arrangements I made arrangements for certain specfic seats and they never gived me my seats on the dept and arrival was the same problem and i really advice old people never to go on because my granny wasnt able to sit comfortably on 7 hours due to the sitting arrangements     Is this still around? After cancelling my with almost no notice (origin and destination not within the travel restricted areas) they cannot be reached by their call centers and emails. They simply just vanished and abandoned all their liability. Hope will be sanctioned for their unsafe and unsound business practices by the regulators when they decide to re appear. That is only after they make sure to pass their losses to the German tax payers and settle to waive their liabilities ofcourse.     With Covid-19, a travel ban was placed between the US and Europe before our family trip to Germany.  Instead of cancelling the flights and returning our money, they kept alternative routes (Within the US) open for us to get to Europe. This was despite the existing travel ban and the POTUS calling back all Americans in Europe at their earliest convenience.  So when our departure date of 3/14 came, only 1 out of 4 flights was cancelled, despite a national travel ban to Europe. Unsurprisingly, no money was returned to us by   This not only endangers customers, but might cause headaches with insurance. Thankfully, we did buy insurance that covers tickets for \"unforeseen circumstances\", but are worried that the lack of cancellations is going to cause issues with our claim.  You learn a lot about people in bad times, and executives are entitled, spineless cowards.  PS: Dont bother calling customer service - it leaves you on hold for 45 mins and then drops the call.     Covid-19 has caught us all unprepared. But its no excuse to con people out of their well deserved refund. My flights have been cancelled by  but what they have done is cancel 7 out of 10 flights a day to the destination, and group all passengers in flights of different times. That way they can call it a \"minor change in schedule\" and avoid having to pay people back for a service they have booked which is not not existing. I know these are tough times for airlines and some may go out of business, but it doesnt mean the individual should be forgotten. Some of us may run into financial difficulties as well, lose our jobs or savings/investments. We are all going to be affected - be fair, or people are going to remember how they have been treated when we get to the other side of these terrible times. I certainly never going to use ever again. I hope others will do the same!     Hello,  Due to Covid19 situation is getting worse in Thaïlande and France,  I contact you by phone to cancel my flytiquet 24april paris - Bangkok and 8mai bangkok-paris. I waited an hour on the phone without anyone answering, and I had to pay for the call because it is a call abroad. Can you cancel my trip and refund the purchase.  Confirmation number: JI574Z Name: benallal Mohammed wehbi Regards, Wehbi     No Stars  cancelled my and left me stranded in Istanbul. Neither their London Office or Manchester office would answer the phone. Their Turkish office told me they did not care and would not help. An appalling company with no regard for the people they transport. Beware.     Flights cancelled due to coronavirus and unreachable.  Cannot get through on phone as they cut the line after waiting 2 hours. No response to email and unable to rebook or get a refund. Will never book with them again. Avoid!     ENG I had the displeasure of flying with in the days of the coronavirus. they canceled me a and, however unpleasant, the most happening in an emergency like this is that planes are canceled; what cannot happen is that the company completely leaves its customers in jeopardy without any assistance! I had to go to the airport (St. petersburg, russia) and they were offered very bad solutions! once I was told to cross the border and sleep at the airport, the second time I was offered a to Moscow when the company knows that with the electronic visa you cannot travel to Moscow and the third time it was even proposed to me to go out with an expired visa and therefore have problems with the border police !!! crazy stuff!!!!  ITA ho avuto il dispiacere di volare con ai tempi del coronavirus. mi hanno cancellato un volo e, per quanto spiacevole, la piu succedere in un emergenza come questa che vengano cancellati degli aerei; quello che non può succedere è che la  compagnia lasci completamente allo sbaraglio i suoi clienti senza nessuna assistenza! mi sono dovuto recare in aeroporto (san pietroburgo, russia) e li mi sono state offerte soluzioni pessime! una volta mi è stato detto di oltrepassare la frontiera e dormire in aeroporto, la seconda volta mi è stato offerto un volo per mosca quando la compagnia sa che col il visto elettronico non si puo viaggiare su Mosca e la terza volta mi è stato addirittura proposto di uscire con il visto scaduto e quindi avere problemi con la polizia di frontiera!!! roba da matti!!!!     Even when making allowance for the current extraordinary global circumstances,  and with the exception of a few individual crew members & ground staff,  and 1 specific action per email, service is shockingly poor. The goodwill in relation to changes / rebookings as a result of corona virus impact  is total rubbish. The website is not user friendly, ones LH ID means very little and the app is possibly the most useless ever experienced. Hours on the telephone to call centres in Germany, UK, Netherlands and South Africa and even clearly marked emails were of no use - no reply and/or no response. Their claim to give priority to pax travelling within 3 days, like the rebooking goodwill, is rubbish and amounts to a  PR strategy. Having my baggage left behind and having no way to reach them and trace it was the proverbial last straw.  Online trace system does not work and phoning is of no use... unless one wishes to spend as much on telephone charges as they charged for a so-called goodwill coronavirus booking change!  In addition to the above, meals on certain legs are terrible, especially vegetarian. The seating plan is outrightly misleading (& NOT because of aircraft changes) and charging pax for specific seat reservations is therefor tantamount to fraud. The aircraft were dirty (on 2 long haul flights) - more than usual and more than what is expected or acceptable. Finding waste in seat pockets when boarding is gross. Wondering about cushions and blankets and hence being afraid to use them makes for an uncomfortable journey. Seeing dirty floors before take off leaves one wondering if any cleaning at all was done after the previous pax disembarked.  All in all, and based on much travelling over many years, the most disappointing experience that leaves me feeling financially ripped off and clear that as a pax I am of no value to them (short or long term). To be clear, cancellation and anything directly related to government orders (because of corona virus) has NOT influenced this review.     Completamente irragionevole non consentire cambio nome, nemmeno a pagamento, in una situazione di emergenza come quella attuale. Operatore estremamente scortese.  Totally unreasonable to make changing name impossibile especially during this incredibly difficult and stressful time. Call center employee was rude and unlikeable.     Even one star cant do the justice. Terrible and horrible dealing of COVID-19s impact and very discriminating and unpredictable fee waiver policy. Its a complete mess including its website and never functioning service center. Even considering the role the exceptional situation is playing, this unprofessional management of the crisis tells a lot about its capacity. Not worth the exorbitant price and fee.     Really bad. Cancelled and only option online was refund. After 55 min in que on telephone listening to a really annoying melody I was able to rebook. Got a five hour extra waiting time in an airport.  Understand that planes have to be cancelled sometimes but the way handles it is really bad.     Devastated by NON EXISTING customer service during the coronavirus cancellations. Phones shut down and no email response this is a disgrace. We have a long trip booked via to copenhagen - Frankfurt - San Francisco  April 10-24 and they are not willing to even hear us out.     Booked Round trip from Paris to Bangalore and Bangalore to Paris for my 30 days vacation with   My return was originally scheduled for 18th/Mar/2020 which got cancelled and shifted to 19th/March/2020. I m just 3 days away from my on the 19ths when I got informed by that my return has been cancelled.  hasnt helped at all in arranging an alternative return to Paris. But insisted I must call service center. I did. Called more than 100 times with no answer at all.  I am completely devastated with no more options. My visa expires on the 20th/March. I regret doing business with  I strongly oppose recommending to anyone and everyone.     Luthansa airlines.  Uae this POS nazil you will def be conned . So called call centre ismanaged by inbreds from india who cant speak english, but give themselves english names. This POS nazil german hitler wil def con you and will ignore all emails and their phone lines will not pick up or connect.  F...K You Luthansa you nazil sucm c>>>>     In February 2020 , Me my husband and my 5 month old son traveled to India from United States via airlines. This was our first experience with  I wouldnt recommend anyone to choose  This is worst I have ever seen.  First when we were going to India we had stay in Frankfort , over there the security man was so much rude especially with people who had young babies like us he does not how to speak with women,I couldnt see his name . He fought with 2-3 couples who had very young children including us over there. And when we were coming back to United States we called online to ask about extra luggage charges they told us $100 . And when we checked in Delhi airport the man who was checking in he wrote $100 on slip for extra luggage charges and told us to deposit on other counter , my husband swiped  credit card over there as they didnt give  any payment receipt to us. After that when we checked our credit card statement they charged $287+ text. We were shocked like how they can do it.   When we called them again regarding our charges they said we are charging this amount for all but why they wrote on slip $100 and why didnt they tell same time and why they didnt Give us receipt. Their workers in Delhi airport including manager are very rude. They needs some professional maners .   As well as they didnt gave bassinet to our baby  while coming back when we asked they said we have 14 babies and we I checked the front seats there were other middle age passengers sitting those who doesnt have babies. They lied to us. We had very bad experience with this   I wouldnt recommend this especially people who have very young children. And Ill never go with this again.  Very expensive but cheap service  &#128078;&#127996;. Wont see you again.     Our holiday to Asia was cancelled due to the Coronavirus. We had pre booked seats with to sit together on the journey. As we were no longer flying, i requested a refund on these seats, but refused our request. I find it unbelievable that can charge us to sit together on flights we were not even on due to no fault of our own. Terrible company. Avoid.     Bad bad bad customer service from India OMG kill me feels not talk to a human     worst company ever seen, due to corona virus i had to cancel my ticket as my wife conditions is not well, but they refused to pay us back, they dont deserve a Penny.     My wife and had the unfortunate pleasure of flying air today. The whole trip we received poor service. My wife asked on numerous occasions during meal times to ask the passenger in front of her to lift his chair, but they simply said they would and did absolutely nothing. We constantly got overlooked and had to get the airhostesss attention  just to be served properly. The food was also very poor and unappetizing. In the light of all the Corona virus worries we had people sitting next to us snorting and coughing the whole trip and were making no effort to cover up or protect others around them. We were absolutely disgusted not to mention concerned for our own well being. I find it extremely poor that in the light of all that has been publicised around the corona virus the passenger was not properly screened or given a mask.  We will.most definitely not be flying with them ever again considering their poor service to ther passengers.     Bad customer service at the SFO airport. The counter manager refused that my baby and I traveled with my husband because of a booking error from the online travel agent. The baby had a separate booking number and his ticket could not be issued. He had made up his mind that we were not going to travel and did not put much effort into trying to fix the issue.  I think because the was full and they needed extra seats. The next day, when my online travel agent couldnt fix the booking,  I went back to the airport and the same guy that couldnt fix my issue the previous day fixed it.     from Birmingham to Frankfurt delayed by one of the recent storms (10/2), which I appreciate is out of the airlines control.  However, they left the luggage behind without telling the passengers, and we waited for an hour by the carousel at Frankfurt before being told there was no luggage. Then I had to wait for an hour in a queue to fill out the lost luggage forms, and waited for 24 hours for my case to turn up. Not good as I was at a business conference in Frankfurt.  I understand delays due to weather but the poor communication is unforgiveable.     Very Poor Customer Service  Had flights booked for Hong Kong in March but have had to cancel due to Corona Virus preventing me from embarking on a cruise . No refund offered despite website stating that services being reduced in March! Never again.     Have flights booked to Hong Kong, will show no lenancy in rebooking to a later date. Hotel in Hong Kong has cancelled and my options are either cancel the €800 flights with 0 refund or go to quarantined and closed down Hong Kong for a week with no hotel.    Was very happy paying more than the difference in price to book flights later in the year but my options were either cancel or just go.     very bad experience with  i used to fly with them years ago and decided to give them a try, horrible service. very rude staff and they even forgot to give me a seat belt for my infant.   where is the safety in the  how can they take off with without having a seatbelt for my 1.5 year old ?  her excuse was we were not aware we had baby on boarding apologized after take of when it was too late..    during the i asked for baby food they said they are too busy and need to serve everyone first then they can heat up the food for my baby,,, since when do adults come before kids?dont kids usually get there food first?   i was even yelled at for placing two trays on top of each other ( was trying to avoid my baby to kick them over ) and she refused to remove my tray when i asked why she didnt collect it she snapped and said next time dont place them on top of eachother... and the incidents goes on and on and on... Do not recommend     We flew from Munich to Dublin on 4th Feb. No problem whatsoever with the in anyway BUT, my credit card has 5  separate charges applied and my bank had added a NON STERLING fee against my card thereby increasing the actual cost of my tickets. Is this normal ?????.     HORRIBLE. I flew from SFO to Frankfurt then took a connecting on to Dublin after a 2 hour layover. I thought this was going to be a nice short since it was only 2 hours but boy was I wrong. I got to my seat only to find an off duty attendant sitting in my window seat. I thought it wasnt a big deal since it was a short so didnt bother but regretted it. A child sat next to me and the ENTIRE she was leaning over me (while leaning on my legs), getting in my space literally in front of my face, trying to get the child to talk. Mind you I was running off of no sleep for 24+ hours so this was extremely irritating and uncomfortable. This 2 hour felt longer than the 10+ hours from sfo to Frankfurt. I asked her if she wanted to switch since the window was mine any way but she REFUSED! And asked if the child wanted to move. Unbelievable. And even after she knew I was uncomfortable continued to get in my space. Extremely rude. Never experienced anything like this and will never fly again.     When you get in trouble with they will come up with lies to hide there mistake.  I had a return when i was at the airport they told me your ticket has been refunded for 22 days ago so you can not travel. When i contact they come up with a lie and told me we have refunded you because you was not at the airport. they had Refunded me 22 days before my   they dont answer me at all.  My ticket got refunded because i was not at the airport 22 days before my  so stupied of  they just want money     Bad experience. I am a frequent flyer and I have never experienced such unprofessional treatment, from booking, customer service, attendants. It makes the trip a very stressful experience. I will not travel again  especially for long distances.     We took a from London to Bangkok with a stopover in Munich. The in Munich was delayed by 6 hours without any explanation given. The delay was exhausting and are supposed to provide compensation for delays over 5 hours as per EU regulations but the is still disputing this. Ive just found out that the back is delayed by 75 mins so will be missing the connecting back to London. Awful  very inefficient, rude and make travelling so stressful. Dont recommend them if you value your sanity and well being.  Additionally its worth noting that despite booking directly with  the long haul between Munich and Bangkok was operated by their budget Eurowings, this was an awful  The food was inedible and despite it being a 13 hour you could not have a blanket or pillow without payment. Ive flown economy with Norweigan before and it was a much better experience. I will never use again.     AVOID AT ALL COSTS. ABSOLUTE NIGHTMARE  Was refused to check-in and was forced to buy a return ticket on the spot in airport as \"i did not have visa for more than 30 days\" to the destination, despite showing official gov websites that with my citizenship I do not need visa and besides I was flying away from that country in 2 weeks. I gave in as it was less than 1h till  I confirmed several times that I can cancel this ticket as soon as I arrive (because obviously I didnt need it) and get full refund. I was repeatedly told \"yes, you can get full refund\" by several people from staff at the airport.  After arrival turns out they lost my luggage. I called them up and asked for full refund. Got the confirmation email saying that they will keep the service charge. I replied \"hey, I did not need this ticket in the first place - please give me back all mo money\". No response...  Fast forward 2 months and about 6 ignored emails from me following up to no avail. I am back from my travels. Still no refund. Got in touch with them via official feedback form, tried to appeal to reason, attached previous emails, screenshots, restoring timeline of the events and asking \"guys, you did wrong. I didnt need that ticket. You promised a refund - here is the email of your team member. Please give my money back\". No response. Then 2 weeks later some 65% refund comes in my account. Another 2 weeks passes I get canned email \"hey you refunded you!\". Wonderful, great! Truly amazing and I am so grateful for you returning me 65% of money that I wasnt even supposed to spend.  Now is the interesting part. I disputed the transaction via AMEX. send them documents confirming that this booking was \"non-refundable\". :D Yet I have an email confirmation that I will get my money back, got some 65% of the sum back and now it is suddenly \"non-refundable\". Disputed the case twice, both times lost. Also if you are reading this and think that Section 75 will somehow protect you from despicable charges - you will be disappointed. AMEX dispute team was no helpful at all. They do not \"protect\" you anyhow, I suspect their dispute team is there to comply with the law, not to actually execute on it.  Summary  Staff is rude, unprofessional. No respect for customer. They will ignore your emails, replies will be canned and please dont make my mistake thinking creating  long email with details will somehow solve anything. It will be ignored entirely.   RUDE STAFF. IGNORE EMAILS. DISRESPECTFUL. NEGLIGENT.  KEEP AWAY FROM  AN ABSOLUTE ABOMINATION OF CUSTOMER SERVICE     Leave kids under 11 years old sit alone... is under your standard, shame on you... set the Price higher and stop that non family Thing.....     My husband and I travelled from London Heathrow to Leipzig on 19 October 2019. We were due to depart from London at 09.30 and arrive in Leipzig at 13.55. In the event we actually arrived in Leipzig at 20.10, a delay of 6 hours and 15 minutes.  a) LH 901 was due to depart from LHR at 09.30; at approx. 09.10 the departure board showed a delayed departure of 09.55; the incoming arrived at 09.30 and it was announced by the ground staff at the boarding gate that the late arrival was due to check-in problems in FRA (completely at odds with the claim from that it was affected by air traffic control events); b) During the we were advised that we  would all make our connecting flights in Frankfurt and were given the relevant gate numbers; although the landed at approx. 12.30 we did not reach the disembarkation gate (concourse B) until 12.45; c) the walk from concourse B to Gate 19A took about 20 minutes and consequently we did not make LH 158 to Leipzig at 13..00; we were told by gate staff that it had taken off on time and clearly no provision for joining passengers was made; d) we were then directed to customer services near Gate A12 where we were told we had been re-routed to Leipzig via Munich (an unwelcome excursion) and would arrive at 20.00; when we protested about this re-routing and asked to be put on the 17.00 to Leipzig, we were told it was full;  e) we were offered two other alternatives a) a train journey from Frankfurt airport to Leipzig that would take well over 4 hours b) a to Dresden and a suggestion that our daughter drives the 120 kilometers from Leipzig to collect us from Dresden airport (surely it is Lufthansas contractual responsibility to deliver us to Leipzig airport); f) When we arrived at Munich airport we enquired about meal vouchers and were given vouchers with a value of €10 only, insufficient to buy a sandwich and a drink. g) We finally arrived at Leipzig airport on LH 2170 at 20.10, some 6 hours and 15 minutes after the scheduled arrival time of our original  needless to say our luggage was lost en route and was finally delivered to us at 14.30 hours on 20 September (ref: AHL LEJLH53374).    . h) We requested compensation as our arrival was delayed by more than 4 hours (Regulation [EC] 261/2004). Twice has refused to acknowledge any responsibility and therefore I am uploading this report on the review site so that other passengers may know of our extremely bad treatment by      airways are a bunch of THIEVES!!! We purchased 3 business class tickets with this and when we canceled the return they refunded us $60 after their customer support team told us we would be refunded $3500. We were also informed that if the refund did not meet our satisfaction we would be able to have the flights reinstated and based on this information we canceled. We tried to get our flights back and they absolutely refused, flights we paid for!!!!! The customer experience is shocking and their lack of response and willingness to accommodate us is unacceptable. Why does the not calculate your refund on their site and then tell you to call their customer support and then they give you the wrong information!!!! DO NOT SPEND YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY ON THEM!!!!     The plans and the service in is very basic, but this is the part I can accept (You get what you pay), However, when they are completely messing my flights, get me home 24 hours late, have me stay overnight without my suitcase and then say it is all air travel regulation and will not even reimburse me for the items I had to buy, is really unacceptable. I will never fly with them again and recommend to everyone to avoid.     Thought a lot about saying something. Flew a couple of times with them. Ignored arrogant attendants a couple of times, actually caught them gossiping. Been called the dumb ones in the economy section, and so on.  Have a Miles & more card, that never really got me anything.  Now I got cheated from \"Hopper\" they just added my husband to my  Per Hopper changes to be made with carrier, they denied ANY help whatsoever. So disappointed!! Do they really need that 660$ so badly??     I am about to travel to Europe from Australia again. My experience from August 2019 still rankles. I will not be using  I did send them feedback which was treated with indifference.  Took off from Edinburgh 1 hour late aiming to connect in Frankfurt for a to HK and then onto Australia.   staff on Edinburgh said they had no information about connections but assured me that a \"department\" in Frankfurt was working on the delays.   Landed on tarmac at the time the HK was due to leave - no staff to meet us.  Arrived in terminal - no staff to meet us.  Presuming they may have been holding the for us (there were several) or that there might have been a delay I caught a train to the right terminal, raced through security, got stopped by the x-ray machine - apparently I have metal in my elbow and hip that a hand scanner could not find.  Ran to gate; gone.   A staff member there started investigating flights for me. Told everyone arriving behind me to go away.   I had to leave terminal to get to hotel but the only border was open was in a different terminal. I wasnt told this but the border gates I went to were closed and a policeman told me where to go  I caught train to another terminal. Got through border protection after a quiz about what I was doing.   I had a hotel room for 4 hours and had to get up around 4am to resume my trip home!   The good news is that I was transferred to an Etihad and the service was a light year beyond what offer.  I am absolutely certain that I and the other passengers would have made the Hong Kong if staff had met the Edinburgh and assisted us to make the transfer, as the to Hong Kong was also delayed due to weather.  Instead of assistance, neglected us and we had to work it out ourselves. I absolutely understand that things outside of Lufthansas control happen to delay flights, but I do not understand why no effort was made to assist us.  This was the most appalling and shameful lack of service I have ever received by an      For the second time in less than two months, I have experienced a lack of service and customer care with  My recent experience with was on a planned return Business Class from Copenhagen to Mumbai: - Planned departure from Copenhagen to Munich 22.01.20 at 08:55 hrs on LH2441 was delayed until 09:05 - At 09:12 hrs all passengers were informed that one pilot was not feeling well and could not fly to Munich and the would be cancelled. All passengers were to stay for further information. - At 09:17, I received a SMS with information about rebooked flights. At the transfer desk, I was told that I was booked on CPH-FRA and from there on Air India from FRA-BOM. I received the new boarding card, arrival time at 04:20 on 23.01.20 in BOM. - The from FRA was delayed and when checking in, I was told that my bag had never left Copenhagen - Arrived in BOM at 05:30 hrs in the morning (5-1/2 hours delayed) and contacted lost baggage service. service crew would not assist since they claimed that it was the problem of Air India and Air India was not really concerned at all. - The following day I contacted the four phone numbers mentioned on the Property Irregularity Report, however none of the phone numbers worked &#8211; neither did the email. I contacted but was told that I had to speak to Air India and that could not assist &#8211; not even get a contact number despite the fact that it was who changed my     My experience raises two major concerns: 1.&#9;Despite the announcement given to all passengers about the pilot being sick and not able to fly; is bold enough now to issue a different statement about \"air traffic control\", which completely contradicts the information given at the airport to all passengers at the gate. Im sure there is a reason for the change in explanation. I was offered a compensation of EUR 150 for the cancelled  which I would not accept as flying with Air India was not a good experience with sub-standard cleanliness, food and comfort and certainly not what I have paid for.  2.&#9;I never booked a with Air India, but was re-booked by onto this  However, with the missing luggage, would not assist and Air India could not be contacted. This left me in a very difficult situation, which I never agreed to when I purchased my ticket with in the first place.   The experience is not what I would expect from a Business Class with      worst company ever. Please share for other travelers. Missed from Manchester to Istanbul with a connection in Frankfurt. Bought another from the Manchester airport same day to Istanbul cheaper with check in luggage and direct and even though was cheaper. Coming back from Istanbul, check in, they told us our ticket was cancelled because we missed our  They said that we missed the connection in Frankfurt while we didnt even take the from Manchester. How come we were registered as we were in the plane while never took that  How come they cancel our without message or email. We had to buy another ticket with them, £286/ person. What if we didnt have no money coming back from our holiday? So they cancel your ticket, dont refund it and sell your seats to other customers and in plus you have to pay another ticket. Shocking, never again. Travellers be careful in case you miss a Nd also there is no customer service to contact in case you are at the airport, 2 choices : pay or stay there. Im so mad &#128545;&#128545;&#128545;&#128545; By the way for travellers going to Istanbul from.Manchester try pegasus airlines they are cheaper. Please share before they delete my post     Bad experience with and poor customer service     Worst company ever! I used one week on changing my mothers name to her maiden name. My mistake, since  I mistakenly wrote her whole name as it was before she cut out my fathers last name.   They demanded a copy of the divorce certificate from 1979 to change the bmbame to match her passport! It took one week, many emails, lots of calls. Their Oslo office had an answering machine siting office hour during office hours. But noone answered, so I had to call Germany severalt times. Tickets were changed the night before our early departure (06:05).   The plane was delayed, so we allmost missed our new from München. They kept the plane waiting 30 mins for us.   On the fist  we were served 3 x-mas cookies. No tea or coffee, as the machines onboard were broken.  In Marrakesh - no baggage. Waited a long time, then claimed it.   I uploaded the lost luggage form I was given at the lost luggage office.   Then nothing ... NO info, whatsoever!   I managed to find the luggage the next day, by searching for new flights from München.  Lots of time spent on chasing it down, taxi costs, lost booked and prepayed transfer to final destination.  Then LH contacts me a few days later and ask me if I found it! There was no info from the get-go!  I have been in touch with them many times after coming home. They are just answeing bs*** about liability and compensation rules, which are wrong, according to their own website.  They seem to play the «exhaust» game, hoping I will give up my claim.  They first insisted for a week, that I submit documentation for taxi costs, etc. And wants me to show a proof of a (non existing) atm-cash withdrawal for the day after we arrived! We got our local exchange/cash withdrawal done at the airport, while waiting for luggage.   Now that they have receips, unused tickets cash withdrawal receipt from the airport at arrival, taxi receipt, etc. They immediately denied the claim.   They did offer «dinner» as goddwill compensation, and then when I did not accept it, a compensation of less value instead of the «dinner». It doesnt even cover a third of our proven expenses!    I am starting to believe that LHs customer service is outsourcednto feks India or South America. They sertainly do not have contact with the management, where I have insisted they send my complaints. And their accents are very hard to understand. Do not sound German, either.  They take no responsibility, and try to give us lousy 50 Euros for our delayed luggage (much less than their webpage states), and basically just find new ways of denying the claim.   The customer service is not reachable by phone, but two people have called me, now that we are back in Norway. They speak fast «englisg» with such strong accents that it is very hard to understand what they say.   It had been more than one month since the luggage was delayed, left in transit in Germany.  I will never fly again! Over my dead body. It is the WORST and most unreachable and arrogant customer service I have ever dealt with!  My advice: Find another   I am amazed their aircrafts are able to fly.     Terrible service from  Customer contact centre are not well versed in answering questions. Paid for first class tickets - no car waiting in Frankfurt so had to walk to the first class lounge and terrible service on board.   Stick to what you know - oneworld.  This will be the first and last experience. I guess there was a reason the ticket was cheap....     THE ABSOLUTE WORST.   customer service has   1. dropped my calls  2. Not interested to help 3. RUDE  Had notified customer service that I would not be able to make it to my OUTBOUND  I REBOOKED for the following day with Swiss Air and CANCELLED MY RETURN INBOUND  I REPEATEDLY CALLED AND SPOKEN TO CUSTOMER SERVICE TO NOTIFY THAT I WOULD NOT MAKE THE OUTBOUND WHILE  ALSO REBOOKING IT. YET WITHOUT ADVISING ME THEY CANCELLED MY RETURN INBOUND  No one made note of my calls. And when trying to figure out why my return was cancelled they kept telling about their no show policy. Which does not apply to me because i had consistently told them that I had to cancel. My money has been wasted and my whole trip ruined. As a frequent flyer I WILL NEVER FLY ON  I am devastated and furious (to say it lightly). Please be aware and absolutely DO NOT fly on this unless you want your money wasted and to be treated without respect.     Im usually good with reading reviews but this was booked by my husband and this is our first time flying this  hence didnt even check the  Our fight was delayed for over an hour and their reviews shows they are notorious with delays. On getting to Frankfurt the airplane had left without any announcement or notification in the airplane or at the airport. We had to take 2 shuttles and the  gate was changed and had to find our gate as we werent familiar with this  We were forced to pay another 600 euro to book another for the next day. We had to sit in the cold at the airport. I will never ever book this ever again.     Yesterday i have experienced the most awful i have ever had with you. I traveled from Singapore to Frankfurt on LH779 and i have to say i am still under shock because of the poor quality customer service. When i kindly asked the attendant to bring my childs meal, she reluctantly nodded and left, without saying anything. Furthermore, my childs mea (chicken pasta) was freezing cold when served (probably from the fridge) hence it was inedible. Cabin crew served drinks TWICE during a 12.5 hour so have been constantly thirsty. Nobody bothered to come ask what i want although both myself and my husband press the call button couple of times. All i saw yesterday was cabin crew rolling eyes as they would be doing a favour being there. Disgusting service overall.     Terrible customer service, they took £60 to much from my credit card when I booked my flights. After chasing for 5 weeks, they admitted they shouldnt have taken the money and said they would return it....nothing. Now Ive just been told I will need to contact them after I fly in July to get my £60 back! What?! Thats my money, give it back!   Wouldnt never touch again....one of the worst companies I have ever dealt with!  UPDATE Finally they have agreed to refund the money they took in error and this has been processed. Shouldnt have been such hard work though!     Terrible  I fly regularly with between Zürich and Cracow and every time there is a connecting  something goes wrong: either the is delayed, cancelled or my baggage is late. I was asking for compensation multiple times but all my claims have been dismissed. Do not recommend.     These guys dont care about their customers. Cancelled the for my parents and did not compensate the cost of the tickets. I chased them for 4 months and gave up. Do not recommend     Dreadful lost my luggage and was offered only 60 euros for it. Was also ill and could not travel and I had to pay 1700 euros to book my next . I went with another for £200. The cheek of this company. This was my first and last time I am travelling with these guys!  Lesson learnt!  Go on trustpilot and check the reviews first. Secondly I will pay more to fly with a better     Two of us traveled from blr to fra in November 2019. We traveled economy, hence had 1 check in bag and 1 carry on bag each. During check in,the ground staff weighed the check in bag and provided bag tag. We are at the boarding gate,  we scanned the boarding pass and about to enter the  immediately one of the staff comes up and asks to weigh the cabin bags. Isnt there a proper procedure on when to weigh the cabin bags? We had 2 kilos extra, which we had not weighed before. If they had checked luggage during checking in Big bags, we could have moved luggage to low weight bags or given extra luggage to family (who had come to drop us ).  The customer service at India is really unprofessional. They were not giving us satisfactory options to manage the extra luggage, instead they indicated to throw the extra luggage.  As customers of  we have options to courier extra luggage to destination country or store luggage at airport for short period of time to pickup later.  The staff is very rude, unapologetic and do not follow proper procedure. This lead us to lose money for whole baggage because they didnt want to charge only for extra kilos. This is utter money making strategy to check cabin luggage at last minute boarding. Please stop harassing customers and dont give last minute tension. Follow procedure first.  We are very disappointed with staff behaviour. We were already unhappy leaving family, but this last minute check spoilt our experience. We dont want to travel with India. We want to claim the baggage amount refund. Nobody replies to any of feedback given to them.     I purchased a ticket through com on October 28th, 2019 to fly from Bogotá, Colombia to Hamburg, Germany on December 28th/29th. Once the payment was processed, I received an email from online @booking.com with the booking details, including  \"confirmed\" status for each  this can be verified in the attached PDF. Also, I received confirmation from the Financial Institution, once the funds had been debited from the Credit Card. Up to that point everything was fine, as I thought that the ticket had been properly I processed/issued.  I arrived at the El Dorado Airport (BOG) yesterday (Dec 28th) at 6:00PM in order to check-in and board my  after answering the security questions I headed to the counter in order to check-in. The person requested my passport and booking code, which I provided right away. He told me there was a problem with the payment and explained he could not print the boarding pass until the issue was cleared. He called the supervisor in charge, who then requested the assistance of a Customer Care Ambassador named Emilio. I was told to go to the \"Payments\" counter, where Emilio called the Service Center or proper department in order to inquire about what the issue was. The person on the other side of the line told Emilio that the payment was reverse for allegedly \"security reasons\". Emilio told me that they could not print and give me the boarding pass unless I contacted the Customer Service Line in order to make the payment with another Credit Card under the same Booking Code. At that point, it was 7:15PM (19:15PM) and check-in would close in about 45 minutes. So I called right away, and after going on and on with the Representative, who refused to transfer me over to his Supervisor, he said that I was notified via email about the payment issue, however he refrained from telling me on what date the email was sent. I thoroughly checked both my Inbox and Spam Folder and the only emails I received were the iD account creation (Oct 27) and the aforementioned booking confirmation email (Oct 28). Furthermore, he repeatedly stated there was nothing he could do and that I would need to purchase a whole new ticket, for a different and way higher price, something I consider utterly arbitrary. Then I went to talk to Emilio, who basically told me that they could process the payment at the counter but could not secure and offer the same price (COP 2.624.410.00). I was extremely upset at that point, knowing I could not board the as I originally intended, because it was too late 8:00PM (20:00PM) and that I had to supposedly pay a different rate for the same flights. Emilio could tell how upset I was, so he asked for my passport and went to talk with his Supervisor/Manager, after a few minutes he came back and suggested for me to return to the airport today (Dec 29th) at 3:00PM and head to Lufthansas office located in the 4th floor, in order to explain the whole situation to the Supervisor/Manager in charge in order to hopefully board todays LH 543  he elaborated that it is likely that I will have to pay a high rate, but it ultimately depends on the Supervisor/Manager discretion and support.  Ive been flying internationally for more than twenty years, and unfortunately this is the first time Ive had such lackluster experience with an  considering Lufthansas decades-long history, thus being the largest German  overall, I expected extremely better service and support. Ive already made New Year´s Eve celebration plans and this impacts my whole itinerary. Based on the damages and impact caused by the explained events, originated by what I consider a serious discrimination of my payment and willingly withholding information which violates my rights. I expect an immediate solution and legal compensation in order to reach Hamburg, my final destination, as soon as possible. In the scenario that Lufthansas negligence regarding this matter continues, Ill be forced to present this to the competent authorities, filing a formal lawsuit, in order to seek further legal compensation which could result in potential penalties for  not to mention reputational damage in case I contact local news-outlets .     I cant believe this company is GERMAN! Bags lost, flights cancelled, insane!!! Never flying with them again, prefer paying 100€ to 200€ more and have peace of mind!     Absolutely appalling in-service. The air hostesses spent most of their time talking and taking breaks in the back of the plane, and would act frustrated if they had to actually do their job. Never again.     My from London City Airport to Frankfurt was cancelled a couple of hours before the take off time.  No explanation was provided in the cancellation message and no-one could give me an explanation at the airport.  The alternative route I was given meant I arrived to my destination 3 hours, 45 minutes late.  No other flights were cancelled landing at Frankfurt nor taking off from any London airport yet some weeks later, when I wrote to for the 250 euro I am legally entitled to in this scenario they told me the was cancelled due to extreme weather.  Legally the onus is on to provide evidence of extreme weather and to date they have failed to do so despite several requests from me in writing over the past nine months.     Recent long haul from Singapore to Frankfurt on the A380. Full price at a budget service is the best way to describe my experience.  Plane was dirty, only offered food twice which was a disgrace,  toilets were filthy and attendants were miserable.     Need I say more? They have the audacity to double charge me £550 and refuse to give me a refund!!! What a disgusting scam company! Avoid by all means - worst Ive ever had to deal with!     Terrible service - one of the worst flying experiences ever. The staff members behaved entitled and arrogant. I have never experienced such impertinence and dismisivness amongst air hostesses. I will avoid booking flights with at all costs in the future - there are so many other airlines out there that are wayyyy better. The food was also pretty terrible.     We had a massive struggle to check in online as the site did not provide adequate  guidelines regarding the details required of our work permit. Eventually we were blocked from the site stopping us from checking in online. Having exuasted all options we called the helpdesk (that was not very helpful) whom eventually promised us that our seats were secured (booked and confirmed). According to the employee we spoke to all that was required further was for us to arrive early at the airport and check in there. Our seats have already been booked via the phone call however they could not tell us why the online check in stopped us from checking in.  This was a total lie! We arrived early and they allocated us random seats. Luckily my husband and I could still sit next to each other but now we were scrunched up in the middle (literary the middle of the plane - from all sides).   We also had issues when booking the as we wanted to pay in Euros but that cannot be done online when flying from RSA.   Needless to say we will not be flying with Luftansa again.     Travelled with back in August. Ankara to London Heathrow. After waiting for over two hours at arrival for my pram, I still have not received it back, after hundreds of communications via telephone email STILL no reply. Nor received my pram. Have forked our for a new one they need to pay up!     I am totally disappointed with the way prices are shown on lh.de. They show you the list of flights with price per one person, despite the number of passengers you have chosen. So the real costs are hidden, you can not estimate your possible expenses.     This was my first time using  Flying from Berlin, Tiegel via Frankfurt to Lagos. And its my first time leaving a review on Trustpilot for any service provider.  But if my review can help anyone who has other options avoid this  then its all good.  Right from Berlin the staff were brusque and unhelpful. Because of my peculiar situation where Im living in Germany with a British passport but traveling to Nigeria with a Nigerian passport I couldnt use the self-checkin so I tried to explain the situation to a staff who insisted I could only get on the queue if I already had a boarding pass.   Her response was, I dont have time to listen to you.  Getting on the to Frankfurt we were told that due to a catering problem, they could only serve us water and NO hot drinks.  Getting to the connecting to Lagos from Frankfurt, again I met with the same brusqueness. The boarding was stopped for some time because the fuelling machine broke and had to be replaced. But during all that time, there was not a single apology for the delay - we were simply told to await further announcements.  When the boarding was resumed, I went up to ask a question about Premium Economy passengers and was brusquely dismissed by the staff.  Ive traveled from many different airports and with many different airlines including domestic African flights, and this has been one of the worst in terms of customer service.  So why does get so many negative reviews? I think because people who have traveled with other airlines have experienced what good customer service really is and would have gotten used to a certain  standard.  Where I have the option I would NOT choose  I would actually prefer to go via a different country to avoid this   Traveler beware!     After my left  Manchester late I missed my connection. I had another 8 hour wait for the next  I was given a leaflet about compensation by the check in desk but when I claimed was told \" its not our fault \" and no compensation due. To rub it in the email hopes I will book again with them!!! No bloody way.     I am flying with the for the last 18 years and it does not get any better. High prices, poor service and terrible sandwiches all over the place. It is a national shame of Germany! Get your act together      Much worse than ryanair... 1h30min delay for now... still sitting... NEVER FLY WITH PLEASE! STAY AWAY!!!!     Horrible, 45min delayed (for now) and not moving yet... plus they just said unfortunately there is no drinks left for economy class... hahahhahaha. WAY WORSE THAN RYANAIR     I wish I can give o star.  I was on hold for one hour and thirty minutes.  Finally my phone turned off.  This the worst customer service ever.  I want to attract the screen shots showing how long I was on hold but its doesnt have attachment. Worse worse worse Im so mad!!!     In a nutshell.  Bad food. Bad service. Sturdests with attitude. Luftansa is becoming a C rated   Ironically in a 10 hour from Munichto Denver. Cold sandwiches are substutuding hot foods. Serving sandwiches is become a norm!!!  Our family will be avoiding traveling with luftansa in the future unless they act up!     DISGRACEFUL!!   Not only the worst to fly with but the most horrendous customer service provider!   PAY THE EXTRA £100s and fly with AirFrance! Lufthansas customer service line has staff that DO NOT SPEAK ENGLISH but are very proficient at being RUDE!!!  Zenda in particular if you ever have the luck to speak to her will treat you like you are trash about to be put out!!! These staff dont care about the thousands of pounds you could have paid in your tickets!!!!!  Absolutely shady! Since 2016 this company has only gotten worse and worse!!!!!!  FIRE ZENDA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!     I would actually leave a 0 star review but this is not possible. I was forced to have my hand luggage and the laptop bad in front of my legs, despite the fact that I make the hostess notice that in the cabin bad there was a coat occupying the space for a luggage. The answer of the cabin crew was as rude as that of the passenger owning the jacket and I was told that if I was complaining more they wouldnt have had my luggage. Never again with this company     PILOT MISSED HIS TAXI  This is the first and last time I fly with  I missed my connecting because the pilot and his crew failed to organise a taxi to the airport.     Clearly the worst ever. Dont know why people are still using their service. Unable to handle their own staff and very bad at keeping customers money as ransom. Though my ticket was cancelled due to their incompetent cabin crew strike, I havent got refund after three weeks.     Do anything you can to book any other but this one. It is my second and last experience with this horrible airlines. They truly dont care. This time around they knew their attendants were going on strike in Frankfurt two weeks ago. They still checked us in the night before the knowing the strike was the next day. The morning of our to Africa , they sent a text in the morning saying they cancelled the and would look for something else. Their website crashed and you couldnt reach anyone on the phones. We spent 6 hours trying to reach them and only got a normal by contacting Swiss air for help. If we didnt have a travel agent , we would have been on the flights they booked from NJ to Frankfurt to Ethiopia to Kenya landing at 3am. We were both split up since they had us on different airlines. It was insane. They just didnt care. Not the first time but definitely the last. Mention the airlines to anyone and you get almost the same story in one form or another.  Ok  I get it. You dont like customers.     The worst experience and the biggest scam  We have been delayed more then 6 hours to our destination and they just cancelled the  The service quality of has been deteriorated so much. They are not even ready to pay the compensation. Just making fool of customers. Dont ever take flights if you dont want to suffer.     To say my experience with Customer Service was a disappointment is a huge understatement.  Background: I have bought tickets traveling from Frankfurt to Hong Kong in Dec 2019, before the discovery of my pregnancy. In view of the latest political situation in Hong Kong and the fact that over thousands of teargas and fire bullets are fired to civilians on a daily basis, my gynaecologist advised me against visiting Hong Kong, in the attempt of minimizing any potential risks caused by the unknown chemicals fatal to the fetus. I then shared the doctors note with  asking for a cancelation. They replied that out of goodwill, they allow a refund, with a handling fee of Euro 190. I needed to discuss with my family about the offer and said I will call back tomorrow for a confirmation.  Since we have been a loyal LH flyer in the past years, we decided that we will re-route and change our destination to Singapore instead of HK, and would like to seek the possibility of a waiver then of the Euro 190. This is our way of showing our appreciation of their offer by just changing the destination to another long-haul location but not directly canceling it.  While this was simply a counter-proposal to work out alternative solutions, we then received a reply from LH: (1) The Euro 190 handling fee is per person, not per booking (which was not properly relayed to me yesterday) (2) I received a threat from  \"If you do not want to accept our offer we will cancel the goodwill exception once again!!\"  When a customer writes/calls you and seek assistance, why are you giving such an attitude to them? So cannot accept alternative proposals and only know how to threaten customers by withdrawing their goodwill? How is this acceptable in the customer service industry, especially LH is Europes biggest  Does it really live up to its name?  Having read this email threat, I was in huge disappointment and called to speak to the Hotline supervisor. She refused to take my call, and needless to say, their staff at the Service Hotline were also rude.  Conclusion: They offered me a deal (a threat) and Ieft me no options than to accept given my medical conditions. They do not allow any room for alternatives and have no sense of international affair sensitivity - their hotline staff said they do not know/read any news about Hong Kong and do not understand where my request of cancelation came from. While another Star Alliance I have booked flying out from HK sees the HK situation as a massive crisis and offered extensive and passionate help on immediate cancelation with no fee whatsoever.  Being an internationally renowned  I cannot believe has offered such a poor level of service to its passenger. It is nothing to do with the handling fee at all, its all about your attitude - NEVER impose a threat to your customers!!!!  Advice to fellow viewers: NEVER fly with !!!!     Try to travel from Munchen to Copenhagen with   We landed in Munchen from Catania Saturday the 19.10.2019 and were suppose to fly of from the same terminal, terminal 2, at 17.15. But instead, our went to terminal 1, and we did not make the    We were not informed about the change of terminal. I was traveling with a child.  We had to spend the night in Munchen and we given a free hotel, but I have paid for dinner, breakfirst and taxi to and from the hotel. Also I have right to compensation for the lost and waiting time.  The first out of Munchen could give me was over Hamburg the following morning Sunday the 20. at 7.15. I booked my from Muchen to Copenhagen in February. changed the terminal in June. I travled in October. That gave them 4 months to inform their passangers about the change of terminal and to calculate if it was possible for your passangers to make the transfers. In my case it was not. And NO INFORMATION WAS GIVEN.  In the end of all that they tried to give me 200 euro in compensation. I have spend about 130 euro on food and taxi.  But in their own terms they write: If you are involuntarily or voluntarily denied boarding, you have the right to an alternative or to reimbursement and compensation, which can also be provided by cheque or bank transfer or, with your consent, in the form of a gift card. The amount of this payment depends on the distance of the planned route and on the re-routing that has been offered to you: In the case of distances of up to 1,500 km, the compensation is €250, between 1,500 and 3,500 km and for flights of more than 1,500 km within Europe, the compensation is €400 of more than 3,500 km, the compensation is €600.   Since I was involuntarily denied boarding due yo your inregular change of terminal and my travel is up to 1,500 km, the compensation is €250 pr. person plus expences for taxi and meals (€114,25) . That is 614,25.   Still waiting for replay from customer service. Have waited weeks now. Not impressed.     Awful customer service.  I had to reserve a seat and a cot for a   First call - the person said there was an error and hung up.  Second call - error on the system again. I requested to speak to a supervisor, they promised a call back in 24 hours.  Third call - supervisor call back never happened. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was placed on hold for 30 minutes before I had to hang up.  Fourth call - no record of any previous conversations on the system. Supervisor call back refused as \"supervisors dont work on weekends\" contrary to what the previous handler had told me.  Awful service. I would use any other company if I had the choice.     Due to fault my was delayed and subsequently missed my connection from Frankfurt.. After being stranded at Frankfurt I was put through an ordeal as nothing was provided by the and made me kept running from one terminal to the other. I finally reached my intended destination 12 hrs after original planned. And has neither refunded my fare difference for change in class on the new . nor have they compensated me for the delay as per EU regulations. Their team said the delay was due to Heathrow airport and they wont be issuing a refund. Unbelievable! Never flying again     Extremely bad customer service.  They changed my flights out of the blue, and the new flights they offered me were BS.  Wasnt possible to get my money back / refund.  Wasnt possible to receive any written communication, I was forced to do it all via phone call - which was extremely inconvenient as I hardly could understand the person on the other end.  Worst experience ever!     I flew for the first time today.  Dallas/ft worth to Frankfurt. 8.5 hour  I paid extra for a premium economy seat. Extremely disappointed. Seat was very uncomfortable. The recline could of been better. The foot rest was useless. The food was mediocre. I was served dinner which was bland. All I ate was the roll and chocolate brownie. I was starving by the time breakfast was served. No drink/snack service between meals. Felt like a burden to the attendants when I asked for water. I had to ask 3 attendants before being served my water. The movie options were lacking. Overall the was meh! and I couldnt wait to land. I want my money back!!     Very poor customer service and rude staff not happy with their service at all will never recommend it to anyone else.  If there is less than one star I would give it.     My official rating is -1, but cant give this. Customer service is none existence. Lost my Luggage in July. After several emails with slow response,  its now officially lost. I gave them list of contents as requested  on 5-10-19, as of today no reply. Ive emailed them on numerous occasions asking for update /response. Dont even reply with a courteous email, just totally ignored me! Worst Ive ever dealt with. The cheap budget airlines are better,  this is the official of Germany and its a joke. DO NOT USE!     Where to start  Terrible customer service  We booked a for me and my wife. In the airport I was surprised the booking has one person  only. I called the they said they are not able  to refund and they want us to pay an extra ticket to Germany at £500  Wake up, the ticket cost is hardly £130 returns  Most of your ticket is taxes What is these taxes  Shame on you  Never  travel with     An uncaring that believes in corporate vandalism. Our holiday plans were ruined ; offered compensation of £480 in email. Two months later not a penny forthcoming!! you are a joke! How do you stay in business with such poor customer service. Disgraceful.  Dr Ashraf Ghouse  Birmingham, UK     Discriminated against!  I had such a bad service at the airport in Addis Ababa by the crew! I have contacted on Twitter but no reply after 10 hours!  This is the worst customer service and of course I will never book with you again.  However, I expect a really good explanation for the discrimination I have suffered!  Find below my twitters:   \"Hey  @, thank you so much for the horrible service today at Addis Ababa airport. Holding my passports, laughing and insinuating that I am not an European citizen!? No information given, just laughs? I really hope it has nothing to do with the way I look.\"  \"And again, the same situation happened at the gate, the agent advised that he had to look closer at my face. The gentlemans in front of me did not have their passport checked! Is the skin colour part of your security check? Feeling really disappointed!!!!\"  I will not stop seeking for answers for your poor judgement and discriminatory policy ( to say the least).  I am very looking forward to hearing from you.  Constância     Hubby had to fly with them for an emergency.  1 hr  he got there and back on time but was drained from the \"meh\" attitude of Stewards, check in staff etc.  They are ok, but just \"ok\"...     I booked ticket for my Chicago(Ohare Intl airport) trip on 11 Oct 2019.  I selected airlines with 2 transit stop(Zurich & Munich). During the booking process I was asked about USA valid visa which I confirmed. But there was no indication / information about the requirement of transit visa (because of 2 schengen airport transit) during the booking process. This was informed to me only when I reached at the check-in counter to start my journey . At that moment of time there was no support to clarify and help for Transit visa (for the mentioned reason). There was no enough time to find any other solution to start my journey. And ultimately, I left with no other option than to cancel my journey, which was big time, money and business loss for me. My ticket was cancelled but with deduction of INR 22393.00( INR 21294, convenience - INR 1099).     In mid September my husband and I were scheduled to fly with from Hamburg to Vienna. Though our friends assured us we didnt need to, we arrived 2 hours before our was due to leave. There we only two people at the check-in desk and a very long disorganized line of people. About a half hour before our was to depart, a group of us explained our situation to a employee who appeared to be in charge of monitoring the line. She put was all in a separate line and then abandoning us, saying, \"You may make your \" We didnt. We were then moved to another long line of people who were victims of Lufthansas appalling service. While in this line a met a man Bremen who travels a lot for business. He regaled me with horror stories. I asked him why he was flying Lufthausa again. He said, \" Well, it was a last minute decision and they were the only with any seats left\". He paused and said, \" Never again, next time Ill take my car.\" Later we flew Air Canada, what a contrast! Air Canada staff we going up and down line ups, finding people who might miss their flights because of the lines and moving them into an Express line. Air Canada was the model of efficiency and good customer service.  So travellers beware; if you have a choice between Lufthausa and another  I would strongly recommend you take the other      Honestly the WORST experience Ive ever had with an  I travel often and Ive never had such a huge problem before. I was with a family of NINE scheduled to go to Morocco for a 10 day long holiday at the beginning of August. Trying to catch the connection from Frankfurt to Morocco was a disgusting experience, they didnt let us through security! The made NO announcement asking for the 9 passengers who were absent, they made NO wait for us and just left! How can an SEE that there are NINE passengers missing and not do anything about it? Because of their stupidity, we had to stay at Frankfurt airport OVERNIGHT on a waiting list for the next to Morocco. In my family of 9, I had 2 elderly, one who is a heart transplant patient and I also had 5 young children with me. You cannot even imagine how difficult it was to stay at the airport overnight with a big family, with nowhere to sleep or rest. Frankfurt airport is also a disgusting and useless airport, I wouldnt ever recommend using that airport as a connection. They make you go through a second security check even though youve already been through one at your starting airport. They also didnt let us through priority fast track - which they should have since our connection time was only an hour. Security/police staff are racist, they provide no support or help.  The next day, there were no empty seats on the to Morocco so as you can guess, our whole trip had come to an end. Our 10 day holiday that hadnt even started was ruined because of Lufthansas inability to provide good customer service. The staff did not admit their responsibility to the end! It is clearly AND Frankfurt airports responsibility that we missed our  but they had the audacity to blame each other and not admit their faults. Unacceptable.  I applied for my refund as soon as I got back to London and they STILL, to this day have not responded properly. It has been over 2 months and I am still waiting for my money back.   Avoid travelling with  they dont know what customer service is. This was my first and last time using their  Never again.     Terrible service! LH475 was scheduled to leave at 20:35 on Sep. 12 with destination Munich.  Instead, we were left waiting in the Montreal airport until 230am when finally we were told that there was an issue with the plane, and that we would be sent to a hotel and be e-mailed with information. I arrive at the hotel that was in Laval, not Montreal, at 5am. They did not inform us of ANY changes, departure times, etc. I called the call centre to request information regarding our  The lady I spoke to had absolutely not idea that over 300 people were still in Montreal as LH475 did not fly to Munich. She informed me that it was my fault because I didnt arrive to the  She told me on Sep. 13th that the is on schedule to leave at 20:35 Sep. 12th, which is impossible as the didnt leave as the plane was not working.  I returned to the airport at noon on Sep. 13 - no staff was working, and when they finally opened it was to tell us that we would all be sent back to a different hotel and would leave on SEPTEMBER 14th.. and again on Sep. 15th to my final destination of Cluj-Napoca. When I was issued the boarding pass, I received an e-mail from that they CANCELLED my return home that was supposed to be on Oct. 3. I asked the person why this happened, and his response was that shouldnt have happened, thats impossible. He advised me to call call centre and get re-booked. I called and got hung up twice by the call centre agents.   Overall the lack of communication regarding LH 475 and the absolute lack of information given from is appalling. Not once have I received such a terrible and frustrating service with any  I understand completely that there are issues that arise with the plane; however, the fact that there was not communication about what was going on, that we were taken back and forth to the hotel over two days, and with no real answer as to when we would be leaving Montreal is what is not acceptable. I lost three days of my vacation being taken to and from the airport and not being informed of any actual time we would be leaving. Absolutely ridiculous. Would have expected a much better service from such a large      ABHORRENT company. Never in my entire life have I endured such dispicable service.  My family and I have literally been living a nightmare. Our flights were changed mutiple times without adequate notice. Speaking to the \"customer service\" department was a whole other nightmare, it seems like theyve employed thugs without an ounce intelligence, respect or empathy.  AVOID AT ALL COSTS.     Missed our connection to our flights. They advertise a connection while its impossible to catch. It was the first and the last time to fly with them never had sth similar with any other I used (cheap or expensive). Our honey moon was delayed....     Terrible! I have traveled all around the world but nothing amounts to the awful customer service I have experienced from .. if you are fortunate enough to read this review... dont book with them you will only regret it! The staff on the customer service desk in Munich were the most rude people you will ever have the displeasure to meet.. my partner was taken sick and the manager laughs in his face as she told us she wouldnt allow us to board the plane due to his asthma attack we then had to get a taxis to the hospital to be deemed fit to travel by this time we had missed our plane and they refused to help us we had to pay for new tickets and a hotel.. DO NOT TRAVEL WITH      Today 20.10.2019, first from Brusssels to Frankfurt and Frankfurt to Cluj, morning canceled , so rebooked our flights after many hours from Brussels to Munich and then to Cluj, but instead arriving at Cluj from Frankfurt arround 17 PM, we have to wait 7 hours in Munich, to wait until 22:20 the departure to Cluj with arriving date at 01 AM. But again, the from Munich to Cluj, delayed. So in the same day, we have a canceled and after 7 hours, the second delayed. Worse company ever.     5 people in our family was placed 5 different places in the aircraft on a 10 hours  A conscious strategy to force the customers to pay extra in order to keep a family together. A very bad experience.     agents are the worst agents in the world. Very rude and disrespectful. They wont help you ever, dont even try . I tried to add Emotion support dog and when they transferred me to animal care support the extremely rude guy just gang out on me because he couldnt find my reservation I paid for few hours ago . The number is +1 562.366.5454 and he gave me his name as J F ... really? What a pour service. Please do not ever book any flights with !!!     Its firt time im stop at Frankfurt.  First,  My landing around 6am  from Bangkok to Paris via Frankfurt.I have time around  45mins , I need to walk very far almost 4-5km for immigation & next gate. That time was no one around i just try walk very fast  but  i still miss my connedtion &  other ticket around100euro.  When im went to the customer service for help but still halfway of the airport. And wait for customer service around 1.30hr,  Im explain why i miss my  also asking about  my baggage , They told me still in Frankfurt, I was surprised why still here. My baggage should go with to Paris already.  Customer service just told me because you not go with that so baggage sill here and offer to give  me  new ticket,That Its ok.  Just wait next around 6hrs and other just buy new ticket. After i try to asking for letter confirm from about my for  send  to my  travel insurance, But they not give me anything until now.  So i cant do anything with my  travel insurance.  Second  Its not big  problem but not happy because they change gate before my only 2 mins, staff not have service  mind, very stressful and next gate far.  You can imagine if that time  no internet or you not see it. Sure , I can miss my again. Its  was a terrible  very stressful , loss time and  money. Its a bad experience. I would not fly with  again.     We booked almost two months in advance. When we arrived at the check in they said they had overbooked and if we could volunteer to go in another ( KLM ) leaving at the same time. I figured no harm so I ran to the other side of the airport only to be told by KLM that we had not been booked on that and that the gate was closed. So we had to run back all the way to to then be told they could get us on our original   In form of \" compensation\" they offered us €250 each. And put us up in a hotel with a shuttle bus from the airport. But like the previous promise of another , the shuttle was non existent so we ended up paying for taxis out of pocket. Next day when we arrived early to follow the given instructions about the compensation once again, no one knew anything and everything they told us was wrong. The only thing we could do was file a claim online. Of course this is a very convenient way of not dealing with customers. I called and was told if I wanted to make a reservation of course I could talk to someone, but if I have a complaint that can only be done online... nice way of avoiding responsibility and not facing your many unhappy passengers.  So claims filed, and still no reply.... promises are lies .... dont fall for it...     they damaged my suitcase, and they have accepted to pay for it. but still 2 months later they havent payed up yet.  it is the worse costumer experince i ever had, no one to talk to, just copy-paste answers.  very disapointed, at some point i have to give up getting my money back for my suitcase even though klufthansa has accepted to pay.     Our trip from Milan MXP to Baku GYD on Aug 30th and return on Sep 2nd was the worst business class journey I ever had in my life.  I am very disappointed about  specially since a fly often Austrian and Swiss that offer real business class service respectively better economy service than the one we got on this business   1. mxp to fra, not a small city, the feeder was with a partner and so no direct boarding possibility. only via bus.  only 4 business passenger on board but most overhead boxes were already full. I assume by eco passengers. No assistance from the attendants and I had to take down the bags above our seats to be able to place ours.  2. The worst comes now as we boarded after two hours of delay the main to Baku, apparently the whole crew was stopped/controlled by police during two hours. Further and to our big shock, we had to realize that the plane was a short haul plane with a standard short distance seating. The only difference to economy was that nobody was seating between the my wife and I but the size and comfort of the seats are the one of economy.  3. For a 5 hours journey, it is absolutely unacceptable to offer such a uncomfortable accommodation to your business class customers. No comment about the same unpleasant female attendant that we had also on the way back.  4. Baku to Frankfurt again with 1.5 hours delay resulting in a rush in Frankfurt in order not to miss the connection. Obviously the luggage didnt arrive in MXP with us, but only late afternoon the next day.   The reason why we booked business class was because of the 5+ hours journey but knowing about this miserable accommodation, I would have traveled with Turkish Airlines that offer real business class.  Today is October 7th and I am waiting since Sep 2nd about a comment/appoligise from them. Conclusion: never again!!     Hopelessly complicated / faulty login and webpage  To the extend not using for booking flights  Fix please     Worst customer service ever. My was delayed for over 6 hours which resulted in missing my next  Ive asked for compensation. Its been 5 months of emails back and forth. Theyre asking for same information over and over. Very frustrating and poor customer support.  They are Purposely delaying the partial refund which is leas than 15%of the cost.  Zero stars for airlines.     Will not credit your miles, even after using a lot of time on the online form. Only for one of the flights, what happened to the 3 other i also filed?     Totally incompetent, unhelpful customer service.   website clearly states the taxes on flights for 12-15 year olds is not applicable however their website does not allow you to book such a ticket without paying it. I called the given number and was told to book it and then call to claim the tax back. Called back and was told I could only claim it after the  Called back after the and was told I should have claimed it before the  Since then I have called and emailed to be told a variety of things including; your refund should be with you in a couple of weeks (never received it); cant give you any Customer information without a Power of Attorney (the child is my niece) I am not asking for any of her information and they took my money to buy her without a Power of Attorney; also told \"I dont understand what you are asking for\"; and most of my calls involved a lengthy period on hold as they had no idea what I was talking about. I have given up getting this tax refunded and will simply not fly myself, or my family with again.     was almost 2 hours late when I picked it up in Montreal on September 24, 2019. I was supposed to get to Naples by way of Frankfurt but I missed my connecting because of them. They rebooked me on a later with a six hour wait. Then they lost my bag after informing me that it would be on my new  I am now in Naples with just the clothes on my back.  U dont know if or whethee theyll find the bag. This is such shoddy treatment  Please consider this story if youre thinking of flying with them.     Terrible racists company  not helpful at all I booked a 3 weeks ago and now I got a plane witch was delayed because of them and now we get to Germany and now I have no visa to enter Germany and now they rebook my to luanda for 10pm imagine 10pm for the next day they put us to sleep on benches on BENCHES NEVER AGAIN ON THIS GERMAN ARE RACISTS PEOPLE I COMPLAIN AND THEY SAY HOW IM SHOUTING AND THEY WONT DEAL WITH ME IM TAKING THIS FURTHER WATCH IM TAKING THIS TO COURT IF NEEDED RUDE STUCK UP EMPLOYEES NO HELP SCAM OF A COMPANY NEVER BOOK WITH THESE PEOPLE YOU WILL END UP STRANDED IN ANOTHER COUNTRY WITH NOTHING TO DO AND THEY WONT HELP EVEN THOUGH ITS THERE FAULT     Wow. I read comments and they confirm my concerns about drastic deterioration of  My advice, people,try to avoid this company. They are experiencing systematic crysis of management and customer service. My experience was simply terrible. You get late on the next connection due to their delay, you claim refund, your baggage is lost, you are desperate: they just ignore you. Stupid me, I should read these reviews before I booked that ticket.     Booked a multi city ticket with Exepdia at EUR 600+. Entered my initials instead of my first name, which renders ticket invalid. Called within 24 hrs, but was told that Expedia did not succeed in changing name with carrier  LHs policy is to refuse any name changes. My only option? To cancel the   Its time acting difficult about name changes is a thing of the past, especially in a time when were required to provide the with Advanced Passenger Information (API) before actually flying. This has nothing to do with security -- its a business model. Most other airlines have moved into the 21st century. Even EasyJet allows name changes, albeit at a ridiculous fee.  My reason for never booking with Expedia or flying again: both companies customer service is unhelpful and is simply instructed to refer to \"the policy.\" The only thing that went well was to cancel the  why? Because youre refunded just a little over 100 euros (mostly Expedia to blame here). And they get to sell your ticket again.  Oh, and if you actually take the effort to file a complaint: they reply to your e-mail saying you should call customer service.  Complete and utter bullsh*t. Never again.     I have now for 9 weeks been trying to get in touch with Customer Relations Team regarding a very unpleasant experience we had onboard a from Frankfurt to Orlando on the July 23.  Upon this my wife discovered razor sharp pieces of glass in her a la carte menu &#8211; that luckily only left her with minor cuts in her mouth. This was reported to the chief purser that urged me to write Customer Relations that only send us a standard apology with a suggestion of a compensation that was a joke. This I declined and wrote to them to open a discussion and a dialogue &#8211; on July 30. Ever since that I have been completely ignored. They have completely ignored the fact that this could have caused a life threatening situation and have taken or shown no responsibility towards us.  I am, myself a Miles and More Senator and Im appalled that this is the level of service and responsibility that shows. NEVER FLY WITH AGAIN..  Jesper Engsig     I hardly know where to begin, or end, the report of how horribly treated both my husband (ticket issue) and me (lost luggage) on the same flights together!   Aggressive rude service personnel, malfunctioning website, forced my husband to buy his ticket TWICE and loved every euro of it.   NEVER fly on this !!!     Be honest with you if I would have an option to put zero starts I would. The worst experience I ever had was traveling with  I used them couple of weeks ago traveling from Miami International airport to Kiev Borispil in Ukraine. I was visiting my family there. Upon my arrival i couldnt find my luggage and as a result i was told that it never arrived to a final destination. I had  spent an extra time at Borispil completing some paper work and had to leave to my moms house without my stuff. I have been calling about my luggage every single day and 5 days later I was told that it never left Miami. It was delivered to me in 6 days but the worst part was when I opened it some of my stuff were missing, those were presents for my family. I filled the  complain  immediately with Borispil airport with missing and stolen department, they all were very pleasant to me and said theyll do their best to look at the cameras and see if they can find anything. Unfortunately today they have contacted me and said they they checked the cameras and my luggage was never opened in Ukraine. I just feel if would put my luggage on the plane right away we would avoid this situation. I am very upset about all of this and as a result I will never ever book a with them. I have been traveling for 10 yrs and never had such a horrible experience. I hope my feed back will help. DO NOT BOOK A WITH      used to be one of the best companies.  Nowadays things have changed for the worse.  My latest travel experience, about a month ago, can be summed up in few words: I have paid around 500 euros and - I have arrived in Helsinki and my luggage hab been lost in Frankfurt am Main and I had to go back to the airport the next day to pick it up ( and waited half an hour for someone to pay attention to my request).  Before going to the airport, I have called customer service and have been charged 12 euros to hear that my luggage was still reported missing. - There has been no meal on board (even though it was included in the price)  - The time to change planes in Frankfurt and Munich is always so short that I literally have to run from one side of the airport to the other to get on the next plane on time.    -  I have been charged a ridiculous 130 EUROS for a 4 KGS overweight.   I will definitely avoid flying in the future.     Kundenservice takes ages and isnt helpful at all. Expected more for the price.     Absolutely dreadful Customer Service.  Totally disorganised Airport Management. boasts the largest in Europe - Large equals chaotic in our experience. We patiently waited at our gate for news of our departure and asked the service staff if there was an update.  No update was given and our departed without us would you believe from another gate which was not only unannounced -  no message either text or otherwise was passed on to we their passengers.  We were then directed to the Service Centre andtreated abysmally. The Team Leader we spoke to used an aggressive tone and her demeaning manner was totally unacceptable. We were stranded for 24 hours and our additional costs escalated to £500.  What is interesting on the rearranged is all notifications i.e. update of departure and gate were received right up until boarding the aircraft.  We are World Travellers and very familiar with airport language and routines . is a disgrace and needs to sharpen up and train their staff to be Customer Friendly . Boasting about being the largest in Europe is certainly not something to be proud of when your customers are treated with disdain and aggression.     Lately one of the worst airlines you could possibly fly with. The website doesnt work most of the times. The login procedure is the most cumbersome you could imagine with iD, iles and More username, card number, pin, password and what not. Whoever came up with this never tried to use their creation.  The onboard experience is one of the worst Ive had in a long time together with the boarding process.  To get such a service I can easily travel low-cost instead.     This review is for their Customer Care I have later edited my review from 1 to 4 stars. Had issues with adding my flights operated by non-airlines but which were also part of the Miles Alliance (I received a technical error from the website). After several emails, my flights have been added, problem solved. Advice: check the Spam folder, several of their emails made it there.     We are now into the fourth month of delaying their compensation of our claim for delayed departure in June 2019.  Although they have admitted to compensating us for the delayed  they have now spent 4 months asking for \"new\" banking information in order for them to process the payment.  One can Wonder why they start asking for this at their complaint formular, if they dont use this informations for any thing at all.  Strange are also the things that they ask for, since you can transfer money to others if you have their SWIFT address and IBAN number. (I know this as I work with the banking industry).  Lets see how long it now will take to process the payment after they got ALL bankinformation in ONE mail today.     Terrible service, terrible airways, terrible staff terrible food, terrible cancellation policy. Disappointment level 10.0. Something is going terribly wrong with the almighty  Klm forever.     E booked tickets to Romania for our daughter but had to cancel. We cancelled in time and recieved a cancellation confirm email with a statement of a refund with an administrative charge. So far we have recieved NOTHING. They make so many excuses to dishearten you into submission every time we contact them but after chasing them for 2 months we realise that their cancellation policy is just to get you to book with them but they have no intention of paying. Shame on you  you dont deserve to be an of a great country like Germany.     The food on a long haul fron New Yotk to Frankfurt was terrible A little bowl of rice and som chikken in a tomatosauce.Dessert was som kind of choklarpudding, not werry tasty. Just before landing they wouls serve a breakfast.   A paptray witk a little youghurt an e blueberrypie.  ONE cup of cofee and a little orangejuice.NO bread at all..     My family had the worst experience with from the very beginning.  We were told a lot of airlines no longer allow luggages so I called directly to buy the tickets to avoid any issues.  Once I gave the representative the credit card and processed it she explained to me that it was United sponsored by   I was very upset but I let it go.  The day came to travel on 8/8/19 and there was a 6 hour delay without giving us any information.  I have a toddler and this was an absolute nightmare. They also changed the gate 5 times to run around with a toddler after all that wait and everytime weer about to board we get switched gates. Finally we left, a lot of people on the missed their connection flights including us.  They had representatives helping to rebook the connecting   We got ours which was directly with got our boarding passes which was another 6 hour wait.  We finally got to our final destination, Malta.  A few days later I called to extend my trip to spend more time with my family and  I was informed my return was cancelled and to rebook it is going to cost me $300/pp I had a panic attack and they immediately told me that I am being anti social.  They refused to help me rebook me.  They kept asking me to call United to connect with to let them know that this happened because of United.  There was a lot of back and forth every-time United called they refused to assist and changed their decision every time.  We had to buy our tickets all over again.  Our insurance is asking for documentation for reason of cancellation and they are refusing to give this information. They are an from hell.  took the money United was a number and they are refusing to help.  If we did not call we would have never found out.  DO NOT TAKE THIS   At no point in time did they give us anything for food or drinks.  A 14 hour trip turned into a 30 hour trip.  There was no understanding on their end.  It was absolutely horrible.     I am a frequent flayer and I take occasionally both for short and long distance. I never had problems, but my recently my was delayed and I missed a connection during a family emergency. The staff at the airport was very kind and I had no problem to receive a decent hotel, and re-arranging immediately the for the next day. Unfortunately, the missed connection implied losing a car rent and other troubles. The customer service agreed immediately a compensation without involving lawyers or mediators. Well, to be honest I agree also with other reviews: it took quite some time to receive a confirm and a feedback after the first email. At one point, I also thought they disappeared...But the money arrived when they said (and my bank did not communicate it). Even when I was annoyed they were very professional. I understand the complaints by other passengers, but between all the troubles I had in my flights around the world has been the one of the few companies that really took responsibility when there were problems. And for me this is a fully deserved 5 star!     My husband and I are both booked on a from SAN to FRA business class however there only seems to be one seat available per the seat map.  To make sure there are no issues, I have been trying to call however it has been over an hour on hold with no answer?     Flew a 747 from US to Europe. The Attendants and service were very good. The seats were very cramped and uncomfortable. I would strongly recommend bringing your own headphones the ones they supplied were terrible. There were a lot of movies to choose from. Ill probably be flying them again soon. If I have extra $ Ill go 1st class for some comfort but the upgrade is expensive.     I booked a for my daughter through from Glasgow to Bucharest. Due to unforseen circumstances I had to cancel the 2 weeks before departure date. The was almost £400. Almost 6 weeks later I have received £0 refund. I have sent several emails which seem to be stalling me off. They have asked for  a Power of Attorney consent from my daughter before they deal with my refund!! This is outrageous behaviour & in my opinion fradulemt behaviour. Please refund my money     I booked for the last weekend of June 2019 a journey for my fiancé and my little boy (one year old) to join me in Amsterdam for a lovely weekend and I bought the tickets for both side with  their connection in Munich to Amsterdam has been delayed for more than 4 hours and due to many informations and change of the gate, they missed their final connection in evening. Once my fiancé realised his mistake, he got in touch with desk to find an alternative and they couldt offer something in the same day due to fully booked flights also in the next day. The person working at the desk promised us (I was with him by phone to find the best alternative) that if I will book another from my one, they will maintain the return  I did it and I booked a new for Munich Amsterdam with KLM at the most expensive price and they flew next day. Then I called to inform them about it and they informed me that no, the return was not valid anymore due to their Terms and Conditions, any note added from the desk agent... so I canceled the return ticket and I booked again a new return with LOT on my own; the cost of the total tickets for the whole weekend has been more expensive than I will never expect!!! and didnt even reply to me about it, any EUC for both passengers confirmed and offered due to the situation, any compensation for the extra fees occurred, any apologies for the fact that the passengers slept in the airport during Fridays evening waiting for their next on the next day (my baby was traumatised after that and couldnt sleep for 2 weeks)!!! you are with a really poor customer services as I tried to contact you again about it, I sent you a new complaint to explain you that it has been the worst weekend ever in our parents life!!! here is my feedback to you FB ID 33137334, I wish to nobody else to get the same experience as us!!!     I risked a transfer from KLM to  It was a mistake. They change the rules after purchasing a ticket and all complaints remain unanswered. It looks like this: you bought a ticket, we change the rules and you have a problem, not us. What will you do to us?You can possibly kiss us in the a....First and last time, never again. Im coming back to proven and reliable carriers.     Worst Customer Support Ever.  They avoid giving you an answer, they are rude. And they take 3 weeks to answer to a email.  They also use the fake, catering company on strike excuse to not serve anything on board.  Star-Alliance my a**     Where to start. The service on all 4 flights was sub standard at absolute best. The food was completely inedible on my long haul resulting in me eating nothing for 11 hours. They also put mushrooms in my meal when I specified Im allergic, and gave me a gelatine dessert even though Im vegetarian. The portions were also teeny with stale bread rolls.The staff were ok on the home but going over was absolutely rude and arrogant with miserable faces and rude attitudes.would reccomend absolutely any and all airlines over this one     My wife and I traveled with last week (LH2443 and LH 2446) and was much disapointed.  1:   Late departure 2:  Bad service, no snack no coffie 3: Rude steward shouting hurry -hurry, but we were not late, was late and apparently has not control over the sedules.  Same thing on our way back - very disapointing. We no longer percieve as a proff operator     The agent at the gate made me check my regulation sized carry-on at the gate and then lost the bag. The person at the Rome airport told me bag would be arriving on a later and promised to deliver it to my hotel the next morning. I told them I was boarding 7 day cruise the next afternoon and that I would only be at the hotel for one night. The next morning came and no luggage, I tried calling the only to be redirected to the airport. The airport couldnt even confirm that my luggage had arrived. I had to go on my 7 day cruise with no clothes to wear.  I complained via their website as soon as I came home, was assigned a case number immediately but have been repeatedly ignored since. This is absolutely the worse travel experience, they ruined a long awaited and expensive family vacation and dont seem to care. They created the issue by making me check my bag and now doesnt want to be bothered. They do not value their customers at all.     Dear Company, in regards to your from Munich to Bangkok, LH 792 of the 08.08.2019, you have not been professional.  I and other tourists believed that the plane was from  as it was specified in the reservation and on the ticket;  while, at the time of embarkation, I and the other people realized that the plane was from Eurowing; In the ticket issued by  it was not specified that the in question would be operated by Eurowing. The name Eurowing did not appear anywhere.You will say that Eurowing is part of the same company, but your behavior was deceptive and unprofessional. Lufthansas aircraft are different from Eurowing, as is the service of the personnel. I will no longer travel with you;  and I will tell this unpleasant on social media.  Michele A. Italy     Flown over 70,000 air miles so far this year and never flown with such a useless bunch of amateurs ever! No infight food available, lost my bag in Frankfurt, took them nearly 2 whole days to get it back to me, and so far, its taken them over 2 weeks to reply to my claim for having to purchase new clothes!!! Hopeless customer service, never come across anything this bad before!!     Choose another  If something goes wrong are horrible !     Unbeliebable : nearly all major european airlines have 1 star !! Rating : VERY BAD !!! Also blames low cost carriers for their repeating losses ??!! No Mr. Spohr !! It is YOUR incompetence !! YOUR FAIL in underdtanding the business rather than triying to copy LCCs strategy !! My experiences with LH are very bad too. German arrogance no one likes to pay for !!     I wish I could give it 0 stars. is a pathetic which should not be allowed in any other country.   My wife was traveling through on 3rd july from Delhi to San Francisco via Frankfurt. from Delhi to Frankfurt got delayed by 2.5 hrs due to which connecting was missed. After talking to several people new was booked on next day which means my wife had to stay in Franfurt airport for 24 hrs. While the new was being booked everyone was getting stay and food but only Indian were being denied for stay and food but rest everyone who were US citizen or citizen of other country were granted stay and food. They said you they will not provide the stay to my wife. Moreover, the airport closes at 6:30 PM, so you wont see anyone at the airport too.  I had to book a stay for my wife for which I payed. After the trip when I called the airlines they said to submit a reimbursement. After submitting the reimbursement if was a long to and fro where they reply after 5 days saying same thing that they wont reimburse because they delay happened because of AIR TRAFFIC control and they are not liable for that. Stupid reason from stupid airlines.  Pathetic airlines. 0 star   If you want to your travel to be pleasant dont choose this specially Indians).     We offer a low rating because we expected more. It felt low cost, even though they make out they offer full service. Our flights were delayed, late, and poor snacks and drinks. It seems that they are cost cutting, getting cheap, and losing quality and service. Sorry &#128528;  They matched well to our China Eastern Airlines experience. We were hoping for a step up, sadly no.     Terrible experience with  made a mistake while booking a ticket and booked for one day earlier. Refused to da absolutely any help, literally gave me no options at all.     DISSAPOINTMENT , VERY UNPROFESSIONAL CUSTOMER SERVICE  Case : FB ID 33083628  This mail is to bring your kind attention towards your service and after commitment services.  Unpleasant experience with that particular (LH757). I would say UN PROFESSIONAL and no customer service at all.  It was so embarrassing in the flights to be treated like that. They served me the NON veg food and i am religiously a vegetarian person. I am not allowed to touch meat products. while complaining about the Non Veg meal, they served me the veg meal at last and non veg meal was kept on my tray.   I complained with the customer relation team and they agreed to pay me a small compensation of 250 USD. Which they requested few documents , we have submitted and never heard from them. Case : FB ID 33083628. Its been 3 weeks. NO RESPONSE from them.   team : Please help to retain your commitments.     No Service for customers - still one of the leading Airlines in Europe but due of Price fight even the Service in Business Class gets worth...     Called May 22 2019 as soon I booked seats, realized I made a big mistake 2 minutes after booking, booked them on the wrong plane, called customer service, the first lady was so rude I hung up and called again, this time the guy was much more understanding and pleasant, said he would give me a 90.00 refund for the seats, well its two months later no refund.  Emailed customer relations and was told the refund would takes weeks, received a email yesterday saying they gave me wrong information, I will never fly with them again, but funny thing is they do not card, because these airlines make lots of money and do not need your money and do not care     Extremely bad. Added to my airlines blacklist. I realised  that I have made a mistake on the booking date and booked my to the day before. Having spent £550 for the initial booking (return ticket) had to book a new one way ticket for the day after which cost me £610. The worst of it all was when I was trying to check in on the return  Online check in giving error. Been on the phone, mainly waiting, for more than an hour until having run out of phone limit without any kind of propper help. Had to drive to the airport, wasting an entire day just to be told that the tickets are booked and available to use but theyre blocked because I havent done the initial that I mistakenly had booked for the day before. So the only way for me to fly back was to pay another £400 for a I had already paid for. preferred to have an empty seat on the plane than to let me fly with the ticket I had previously paid. All, its clear that wasnt going to loose any money with me because it all had been paid before and I already had paid a ridiculous amount of money for the that I booked by mistake. Of course I didnt pay the money as I told them if I have to pay to fly out of here Ill give my money to someone else as I thought I already have given too much money to this suckers. I was a frequent flier with thousands of miles on miles and more card and I will never fly with again.     Hi  My and my partners suitcases were not loaded during our connection from Munich to Barcelona. At the Barcelona airport, we were told that our suitcase would arrive at 18:00 the same day and would be delivered to our address the next day. As we were told, our suitcases made it to the airport on Sunday the 14th, but even after 24 hours, they are not delivered to us. We are continuously told by the call center in Barcelona to wait at home. Now the problem is we are here on vacation, and we spent 1.5 day waiting for our suitcases and could not enjoy our limited time in Barcelona. The personnel at the call center also kept saying they cannot help us with anything, and the only way is to wait, even maybe tomorrow. I was wondering what a great company like think about this? This is not satisfactory and helpful at all. How will I get my 1.5 days back in Barcelona because of a mistake did?     Since 2 years one of the most unpunctual airlines . Since weeks they do not offer any snacks or drinks regularly anymore as the catering company is on strike. No adjustments are offered for that drawback. Customer service since 2 years only available by mail. No telephone conversation possible anymore. If you can choose any other  dugout ahead.     2 Way travel my bags was damage on outbound, which ruin my Holliday. on the way back it was lost, despites the fact I was I Frankfurt air port for 6 hours. My recommendation never use     I used to travel with but recently all the I have taken were cancelled or delayed.. Too many times in a row..     This has been by far the most uncooperative Ive dealt with not just for this  but ever (and Ive flown with probably 15+ different airlines worldwide). I have a carry-on that has been allowed to fly with me in the cabin everywhere else, but not with  I know that it perfectly fits in the compartment; however, the check-in agent was unapologetically rude and required me to check it in. The worst part is that she allowed a similar size carry on to be taken in the cabin for the passenger right before me. Im very disappointed with this unprincipally applied policies--I could see, at least, a dozen of other similar carry-ons allowed on the plane and thats discriminatory. All my ceramic and glass souvenirs were broken--the carry-on was supposed to be with me so I can handle it carefully.   They were also supposed to serve complementary soft drinks in the cabin, but guess what--they didnt. All we got was a fake apology. I dont think Ill ever fly with again--in fact, Ill do my best to completely avoid it. Its getting worse and worse with (and the reviews show it).     Worst i have ever had the misfortune to do business with. to Manchester to Katowice via Frankfurt 1st July, late, Katowice left. No support from (it wsas their delay !); no staff in Frankfurt dealing with other than in main lobby so had to exit airside. rebook for afternoon next day, useless, returned. Bag did not arrive for 3 days. No contact; phone contact useless and staff just rude.  Customer focus and experience = 0. Absolutely abysmal. Small claims court next. Feedback ref # FB ID 33133940     So first things first, never but never book a with  There are always travel delays and when you have a delay or a next to catch afterwards, they just let you hanging. My little brother of 8 and my mother stood there at the airport for like 6 hours because refused to give them proper advise. They shouldve arrived around 2 oclock here but instead they arrived at 1 oclock at night. This is absolutely ridiculous and shouldnt be happening. is unreliable and you cant trust them. So follow my advise and dont book at      Our from Frankfurt to Mumbai was cancelled. I tried calling their support number  1 -8 6 6 -9 5 3 -2 2 9 4  and had the worst customer service experience. The number will give 2 options and then end abruptly. Both the options lead you to the same web support which is not available after 6 PM. no online chat.     Unacceptable  Last February, I booked a Singapore - France - Singapore ticket for July for my wife, this is her only holiday of the year, the day before her birthday.  We pay 2000 euros, the day after booking in February, the tickets arrive with an error in the last name, error that we have not made of course, we still know our name and how to fill a form.  We reported it immediately and received an email 4 months later (end of June so, one month from the planned departure), saying that there was nothing to do, that it was our fault and that we had to buy a new ticket. No alternative or refund, simple invitation to redeem a ticket after the customer service hang up on us.  Its just theft and a shame to offer such a mediocre service, employees respond like robots reading scripts, they are of no help. We lost 2000 euros which is half my salary for a ticket that will not be used by anyone because of a name mistake that can not be corrected when there are 30 days left before the  its as absurd as it is appalling, never buy ticket on this company.     Never again This is nuts... I cannot check in and my is less than 20 hours away. The check in web service is down. The technical support phone number they displayed keep hanging me up and they are going to close down at 6PM EST. So for 45 minutes Ive been trying call them but keep getting disconnected. So Im trying the regular customer service phone number Ive been on hold listening to the same stupid elevator musing for the past 25 minutes. Ive been using my cell and my home phone trying to reach ANYONE. This is NUTS. no way, never again. Im worried that by the time we get to the airport my family and I will be sitting all over the plan and not together. I have two kids..... No way. Never again. I will update this review if anything happens.     Worst customer service Ive ever received at Frankfurt airport after my with got cancelled minutes before boarding.  Staff behind the desk were very rude and couldnt answer any of my questions including: why my got cancelled in the first place.  Never flying with again after receiving snarky comments and attitude from two older blonde women working there.     I used this on my trip from JKIA Nairobi to Chicago through Frankfurt and even on my trip back.  I truly believe that this is the worst customer experience ever- the attendants are utterly rude when they are attending to customers, the food is horrible, the aircrafts are extremely dirty. During our transfer at Frankfurt on my return we literary had to run down the aircraft to catch the connecting with no security checks at all. The aircraft from Frankfurt to Nairobi was worse- I dont know what to describe the experience.     I have really enjoyed all my flights with   I have had a few small issues which they resolved but they are my number one star alliance partner to fly.  All Airlines make mistakes and may lose luggage or be delayed.  But if you look at the in experience.  Then this is good.     I purchased multi-city United / Business Class air tickets. On Tuesday May 28th at 8:00 AM I boarded LH 695 Tel Aviv - Frankfurt. In Frankfurt I passed thorough inspections at two different security check points, and took the shuttle bus to Terminal Z where I was instructed to stand in line to have my LH 402 Frankfurt - Newark boarding pass inspected.   I asked the agent at the counter to confirm the departure gate; she stated: \"Z58.\" The passenger behind me stepped forward and said:  \"There was a gate change some time ago; its now Gate Z23\". The agent then lackadaisically checked her computer monitor and said:  \"Oh yeah, youre right.\"  With complete disregard she was about to send me to the wrong gate. Her carelessness could have caused me to miss the had it been on time (the was delayed).  Upon entering the aircraft at gate Z23 for LH 402, I went to the upper deck to look for my seat. As I walked down the isle two attendants at the counter in front of the exits stood and stared at me without saying a word. The boarding process had just begun and there were only two or three other passengers in the entire section. The attendants did not extend any greeting, nor did they offer to assist with my bag. As soon as I stowed my bag in the overhead bin one of the attendants, Ms. Hanschke, approached me and asked:  \"Are you on medication?\" I replied: \"No.\"  She immediately followed with another question:  \"Have you been drinking?\" Again I responded: \"No.\"  I felt this line of questioning to be completely inappropriate and asked why I was being interrogated. Ms. Hanschke answered:  \"Because your behavior is off and you dont look right.\"  Ive literally been in the plane less than 5 minutes, havent yet taken my seat, have done nothing out of the ordinary, and find myself the subject of an outlandish inquiry. I asked myself why am I under this scrutiny, and what entitlement allows this individual to instantly pass judgment on a customer shes never met. Im baffled and insulted by her statement.  I responded: \"Your comments are completely bizarre and very offensive\".  Her reply: \"I ask these questions for your safety\".  Safety? These reprehensible questions under the pretext of safety? I have traveled millions of miles for business and never has the act of putting a carry-on bag in the overhead bin been considered odd behavior. And if Ms. Hanschke does not like the way I look Ill thank her not to share her opinion. I questioned her perception and underlying motives.  Ms. Hanschke then poured wine into glasses on the counter and walked away. I took my seat and sipped a glass. A different attendant, Claudia Loeb, appeared.  She said: \"You smell like alcohol.\"  I replied: \"Perhaps yes, I just took a sip of wine.\"  Ms. Loeb: \"When I sip wine I dont smell of alcohol; you do. You were drinking before you boarded the plane.\"  I responded: \"I find it unusual that you are immune to the smell of alcohol while others are not. Regardless, Ive had nothing to drink until now. Do I need to have your permission to drink?\"  Ms. Loeb: \"Three of my colleagues said you were walking funny. You came from Tel Aviv.\"  I pointed out that the isle is narrow, my bag is heavy, and the steps to the upper deck might have prevented me from meeting to the attendants walking standards. Judging people by the way they walk, and by the way they look, is considered discriminatory.  Whats infinitely more troubling is that I am singled out because I came from Tel Aviv (the shirt I wore bore Hebrew script). Anti-Semitism has no place in society and one expects that it would not be found in the travel / service industry.  I reiterated to Ms. Loeb that I had nothing to drink prior to boarding, Ive done nothing to provoke conflict, and that Im very upset at her affront. She persisted and became belligerent:  \"I smell alcohol and theres something wrong with you.\"  At this point the boarding process had progressed and there are many passengers in the upper deck; everyone is staring at me and theres silence. I am completely humiliated.  I responded: \"Whats wrong with me is that Ive been traveling for two days with very little sleep, and Ive been subjected to hostile confrontation for no reason. Its time for you to leave me alone.\"  Ms. Loeb left. Minutes later Ms. Hanschke re-appeared, states that they \"are just doing their job\", and once again this is all for \"my safety\".  The behavior of these attendants is appalling, absurd, and senseless. I was targeted, subjected to interrogation, attacked and harassed repeatedly, accused of being a drunk, and publicly humiliated. I am at a loss to understand why these employees chose to arbitrarily bully, intimidate, and ridicule me. For the entire I sat nervously anticipating more combative psychological torment and arrived in Newark completely exhausted. This affects my ability to be productive at work.  The problems at are systemic.     Terrible - 3 out of 4 short haul flights via Frankfurt delayed by an average of 30 minutes - no apology or reason given. No onboarding management of passengers, with passengers still standing and lockers open with the plane moving!  Very basic facilities.     The trip itself went well, but I was overcharged for a second piece of luggage. The employees at the airport admitted they were overcharging me compared to the information I was given during booking (Id printed it) but said they could do nothing about it, that their system was set, that I should get in touch later with their customer service to get my money back.  I did as they said, using Lufthansas dedicated page, attached copies of all the proofs, and ... no answer. (Even in my junk mailbox; I did check.) Now I wonder if that discrepancy between the price given at booking and the much higher price at the airport really was a mistake, or if it was a trap. More importantly, I realize that if any other problem or accident had occurred, Lufthansas customer service would have answered in very much the same way &#8212; by ignoring me entirely.     I recently booked flights to New York with on the basis that I thought they were trustworthy and reliable. When I booked the flights the amount was immediately debited from my account. 3 days later theyve taken the same amount again! They have charged me twice and I have not authorised this!!! They have a 2 week refund process and judging by what everyone else says about their awful customer service god knows if Ill actually get my money back in that time!!!! They are absolute thieves and I dont know what gives them the right to do this and unfortunately it seems Im not the first and I wont be the last! They are unsympathetic and dont seem to understand they have taken a large amount of money from my account without permission which now means I am in financial difficulty for paying my bills and being able to provide myself with life essentials, such as food for example!! AVOID AVOID AVOID.     We flew to Cape Town with and this was a trip we saved for a long time - our bucket list trip - and it was ruined because lost our luggage the whole time we were there. We received it on our last night there. The worst part of it all is they did not let us know anything. For example, where it was, when we would get it. They wouldnt answer our calls. Our hotel called so many times and they would give the same answer about not knowing when it is or when we would be getting it. We had to cancel pre booked tours as well as dinner plans for two nights in order to go shopping for the rest of our trip (we already spent money shopping beforehand for all the things we needed for our trip) We had 2 more weeks of travelling after Cape Town and no idea when we would be getting our luggage. So each night we would go shopping for one outfit for the next day which ruined our evening and wasted so much of our time. Our luggage appeared at our hotel on our last night without an explanation or an apology. We have been trying to get a hold of them for 3 weeks now and no response from them regarding our compensation. We still havent received an apology until this day. I have never experienced such terrible customer service and lack of professionalism in my life before. I am writing this review to warn others of our experience because we will never book with them again, nor will my family and friends. Extremely disappointed, upset, frustrated and everything in between. Save yourself the trouble.     Service client inexistant Vol annulé par SMS, et ligne téléphonique non fonctionnelle. A l aéroport de Marseille, pas de comptoir  impossible d obtenir une information quelconque  Feedback ID 32917127  Dear,  I understand airlines cannot be held responsible fort weather conditions; However to me, the problem is not the fact that my was cancelled and/or delayed and/or replaced. The main problem is your poor services regarding client support and assistance. As mentionned earlier the call center was not open ( and was  supposed to be, according to your website). A mayor company  like had NO information to give to a client in this case of a last minute cancelling. Arriving at the Marseille airport, there was no assistance what so ever. No counter, and no star alliance counter. I had to call to germany with my personal phone, for more than one hour, costing me over a 100 euro.  Because of this lack of information, lasting several hours, I had to buy new plane tickets costing me near 900 euro.  You offer me 100 euro per person, this is a joke.  I still request a refund of these extra tickets i had to buy, Because of your poor services and not because of weather conditions.  None of this would have happend, if you have people answering the phone and giving information to passangers.   Kindly,     The worst company ever they are fu***** thieves I bought a ticket and they took the money as soon as I finished and two days later they reserved little over the same amount on my card it has now been over two weeks since I have bought the tickets and they have reserved Almost 1000$ And their customer service is the worse I have ever experienced. I just want my money and I will never use this company ever again I dont understand how you can do this to your customers     My from Chennai to San Diego via Frankfurt in on May 3 2019 was disappointing.  I was travelling to US for the first time and booked in for I had known its the best and a prestigious one too. Unfortunately we missed our because the gates number was changed the last minute and by the time we reached our to San Diego had left. Customer for rebooking was very slow as it was under staffed. Customer service was  rude to customers and one  lady staff shouted and screamed at a passenger evidently a middle aged lady who was travelling for the first time . That poor tired lady passenger was in tears . The catering staff at the service center  were not only understaffed but in very impolite and rude. My from Chennai Frankfurt  arrived late in Frankfurt. Hence delay and missing was not our fault. Added to this all passengers had to pay for the change over for the next a hefty amount. Its not fair. Its their fault.  It was very expensive. We had to pay from our pockets. I felt sorry for all people waiting , spoken to very rudely, and paying heftyly for no fault of their own.  No timely announcement of gate number ,rude staff at SERVICE CENTRE  paying for new route by passengers has changed my mind to omit from my list prestigious airlines.     This is the WORST I have EVER flown with in my 40 years of life.  No one was welcoming, no one was nice, all employees were very combative and extremely rude to us, I demand to speak to upper level management and I will ensure ownership, investors, and any shareholders are well aware that totally accepts racism and not only allows racism but they put Germans ahead of us in order to spite us and they changed our seat arrangements in order to inconvenience us, they specifically made us go upstairs twice and wasted our time, we myself, my wife (pregnant 6 months) and my 13 year old daughter had NO OPTION but to accept this treatment in order to leave country.  I demand a FULL REFUND on all accounts, military, baggage, and pets as they made our pets very irritated because they were projecting very bad negative energy on us.   Also, the younger German lady to the right specifically got up when it was our turn in line and left for a break when there was 20 people in line and ONLY 2 people checking us in.  We will NEVER EVER RETURN to and NEVER visit a again as your hospitality is the WORST of any culture or service driven business in the world.  How does accept such horrible behavior from their employees and staff, these staff should 100% be terminated.  At the very least they should be reprimanded and retrained on CUSTOMER SERVICE and the entire video should be reviewed because this is 100%. Wrong and should never be tolerated ever. Do not fly and your life will be amazing!  UPDATE:. offered nothing in response and doesnt CARE about customer service NOR that it allows BLANTANT RACISM servicing Germans before all Americans and then speaks in German to curse you out as if you dont have a APP that translates all the RACIST REMARKS!     Do not use  Worst experience I ever had! We had booked a to Sevilla from Copenhagen over Frankfurt. Frankfurt Airport closed down because of a drone incident. Thats not fault, but they just landed the plain in Leipzig and left us there. We where told to take the train to Frankfurt. They did not give us a voucher so we had to pay for the transportation. They refused to give us any information about how to get to Sevilla. So now we are on our way to Frankfurt without a rebooking and with no idea about how to get to Sevilla. I have trawelled all over the World but this is the worst service ever.     They send me booking information in RUSSIAN!! Nobody is from Russia, also the trip was not from or to Russia! Extremely idiotic!     Flew to Panama from Manchester, via Frankfurt, with on 3rd April this year. They lost 2 of our suitcases. On arriving in Panama we were told the bags had been left in Frankfurt and assured by staff that the cases would be with us the very next day as they would be sent on the next  There was no the next day, something the staff MUST have known, there was no the next day either... And then they phoned to tell us it had not been put on the next available AGAIN. This was a problem as we were moving on up the country, away from Panama city - a 5 hour drive away. After many phone calls and assurances we finally got our suitcases on the 8th April. They had not been sent to Frankfurt in the first place and had always been in Manchester. We were repeatedly lied to and misadvised by various staff. This meant that we did not buy any new clothes until day 3 by which time we were in a very small rural town with only a handful of actual clothes available to buy. This meant 2 children and one adult were severely inconvienienced. When the cases finally did turn up 2 of our party had to stay in our hotel to await the arrival of the bags in order to sign for them. We therefore missed out on a once in a lifetime trip that had been arranged for that day. This holiday has been hard saved for and much looked forward to. The actions of in simply not telling us the truth; were the bags were and when they were likely to turn up, has ruined our once in a lifetime trip. I would not recommend this  and there are plenty of other choices who fly their routes. We came home with a different  thank goodness.     FINANCIAL HARM CAUSED TO ME BY  I CANNOT USE MY CREDIT CART BECAUSE STOLE MY MONEY. LAWSUIT SOON!!! I would like to warn my fellow travelers about choosing as your chosen when flying abroad. I have been to hell and back courtesy of this chaotic, rude and incompetent company. It is my intention to make my case known so you dont have to go through what I did. My next stop is the FAA, BBB and the media. I ordered flights online using website on April 20th. Outrageously, due to THEIR system glitch, I was given no reservation code. There were no flights booked, nothing!! However, my credit card was charged immediately and the amount was over 10K. Long story short, I called them and no one was able or willing to locate the sale.  Eventually I was told that the sale was found but cancelled. No apologies. No attempt to rebook the flights and compensate me for 5 (yes, five) hours I wanted talking to the outsourced impatient agents who love hanging the phone on you. I got a message on my phone from one of the agents. The funds would be refunded and the hold would be removed in 24 hours. Last Monday I called and spoke to a supervisor who said these \"things\" happen. He repeated I would have the funds back in my credit card and that he would talk to their accounting department. When that didnt happen, I called back on Tuesday. I tried every number in my possession. First the number that left a message (no name was given). I got a bunch of people telling me I called the \"wrong place\". No further explanation!  I then called the customer service line, reservations, and even the Americas CEO Sharon Murphy in NY, where no one answers the phone and there is no way to leave a message if you get a fax line. After many attempts to speak to someone, anyone (a few reps refused to talk to me as I lacked a reservation code but I was never given one!!), one of staff was overly extremely nasty lying that never took my money! I told her I have screenshots of my credit card charges and she went on ignoring that. She also claimed the bank took my money, not  To this moment has not released the funds. None of my emails to customer service and Sharon Murphy CEO were replied to. So now think: if this is how they treat their customers, how do they handle your security? The planes? Problems while abroad? This pathetic has a culture of disorder and ducking calls. No one takes responsibility for anything.  My experience was one of disarray and indifference bordering THEFT. The charges now are in DISPUTE. I recommend to my fellow travelers to never trust  I can only assume that company is on the verge of bankruptcy. I was treated in the most deplorable way. They lack basic integrity. We booked new flights, NOT with  We will stay home if we have to and never use that despicable company. Be warn that they will STEAL your money and provide nothing in return. Its really that surreal. Its really that Kafka like. Its really that obscene. Its really that substandard. If you value your peace of mind and hard earned money, do not fly  To this moment when have not been refunded for the flights I booked and got canceled, without reason, by      Worst communication from a company that I have experienced since the internet started. Terrible website, terrible customer service - cheap labour from Pakistan and similar poor countries.     Worst experience ever&#8230; from beginning to end  Never expected that one of the most reputable air companies can perform so pathetically.   I am a frequent traveler to Japan (from London) and used a great variety of air companies like KLM, Finnair, AirFrance, AirChina, Malaysia Airlines, British Airways, Singapore Airlines etc. and never had any issues with them. This time I tried and received an extremely unpleasant experience that jumps out from the level of service provided by other mentioned companies. 1. Not a single (London-Frankfurt-Osaka and return) departed on time causing severe delays during my journey! 2. Worst in-meal service I have ever seen; 3. Non-existing customer services (no response followed to my official complaint ID 31531519 regarding the disruption of my journey).  More than that, in contrast to other European air companies that have frequent connections to London (i.e. KLM) it looks like tries to save money by cancelling partially booked flights and putting everybody on the last on the day. I had that experience in Frankfurt when two Frankfurt &#8211; London flights were cancelled (for no reason) and everybody was invited on the latest in the evening.  Due to zero response from the customer services (it was the last drop) I will make sure to avoid this company at all costs in the future and will advise to do the same to everybody.     Luggage arrived 36 hours later than the flights arrival, damaged and ripped into pieces.   Was a 9 hour with A MALFUNCTIONING ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM, and no meals- this, despite having ordered these in advance, online. We have paid additional wifi fee as was advised by a most helpful steward in place of the malfunctioning entertainment, however the wifi didnt connect.  We have pre-booked a few seats together since we were traveling a few people as a family and at  at the check in counter we specified and asked to get a confirmation that our seats will indeed remain the way they have been booked by us online, in advance. However once we came on board it all went haywire because on our boarding passes our seats were not the same. Just like that. As though we had never rebooked them online. As though we had not received a confirmation at the check in counter that they would not be changed.  Rude, nasty stewards. Unhelpful at their best, downright outrageous and inappropriate, highly unprofessional behavior at worst. Rolling eyes, expressing contempt in interactions, you would think they were here to serve in prison labour (perhaps they were&#8230;..?). When asked about basics such as entertainment, meals and other things that are a given on all airlines- including cheap ones, they rolled their eyes and brushed us off, just wanted us out of the way and have us sit back down.  WE HAD RECEIVED AN EMAIL CONFIRMING WE WILL BE COMPENSATED AND OUR LOSSES REFUNDED IN FULL- however its 7 weeks later and we HAVE NOT RECEIVED A CENT- not the refund for the suitcases, no compensation for the delayed luggage, no refund for the wifi payment- which was paid as per the recommendation of a steward, however didnt connect. We keep chasing them TO NO AVAIL, its endless waiting on the line until we got through to someone that refused to deal with the matter. On one occasion they said they are waiting for their&#8230;.. very own banks approval. and we are waiting to this day for Lufthansas bank to approve it.. have they gone bankrupt?? If they have, arent they legally obligated to inform us?   One customer services representative by far surpassed all others when upon asking her to speak with her manager or supervisor she said that there are none. I would have assisted her with a better excuse had I not needed something more important from her. She also could not provide any email address for correspondence.     Extremely rude personnel. Changed our seats, lost our luggage and eventually almost removed us from the return (as if we were drunk).     If you want any form of friendly customer service, any help, any warning or explanation for 8 hour delays, then do not use  I will never use them again. No notification of cancelled - only inability to check in with vague message to call customer service. Customer service centre staff have appalling attitudes, rude, unhelpful, resentful of customers. Airport staff have dreadful, rude attitudes - they seriously do not like their customers. Staff on the plane think it OK to make sarcastic comments when passengers ask when the already massively delayed will commence. This is THE worst I have ever flown with. I will never use again.      are you crazy?! Ive asked many times for delay certificate. You sent me certificate but regarding another  The complaint department is constantly answering my messages that the certificate has been sent and will not send the new one. Why do I need a certificate for another ! My insurer demands a valid document! In addition, agreed to send compensation to my bank account. I waited several weeks and asked the claim department for confirmation of bank transfers. Today I received confirmation of bank transfers without an account number (IBAN)! A bank transfer without a bank account number has no chance to reach the recipient! In addition, two cases are pending in the CAA, because Polish staff is lying about the reason for the cancellation - they provide information contrary to what I got from airport service. Really?! Its a five-star ..? FB ID 32861132     Frankfurt-Ashgabat stranded in Baku. Very bad service in helping passengers. Hours without water and food, no help with visum required to reach hotel just outside AirPort. First proposal to just stay in the business lounge (for 24 hours!). Where is the Deutsche Grundlichkeit?!     NEVER.  EVER.  EVER  AGAIN!  My wife and I have been travelling the world for over a decade.  I have never experienced ANYTHING even remotely close to what we have experienced with this absolute sham of an     For starters, my wife and I were travelling to Frankfurt from San Diego with our three year old daughter.  input my name as my wifes name effectively giving my wife two tickets: one for Mr. and one for Mrs.  Unwilling to change the ticket and correct their mistake, they then suggested that I pay for a new ticket ($3,489 more than the ticket we had booked three months prior).  I ended up flying a different and my wife and three year old travelled to Frankfurt by themselves.  No refund issued.  It doesnt stop there...  Their customer service folks are absolutely horrible.  On the way home, cancelled my wifes final leg from San Francisco to San Diego effectively having my three year old travel alone.  We spent three hours with customer service trying to resolve the matter and finally a passenger stepped up and offered their seat.  It doesnt stop there.  We arrived for our home three hours early and checked our babys car seat.  The car seat was never put on the plane and remained in Frankfurt.  They indicated that they would be in touch with delivery information.  It doesnt stop there.  They never called.  The car seat has inexplicably dissapeared and they will not cover any costs associated with the car sear.  This will either be our of business in the next year or they will be have to undergo a MASSIVE overhaul with complete staff replacement.   This has been one of the worst experiences of my entire life.     In November I bought a ticket during Black Friday weekend, but the form on the LH page was so strange that i was not able to check the promotion box ( I paid by transfer and the option was on the card space, I just did not see it). I immediately contacted the customer office, but they refused to refund it, saying that: 1. It was may fault 2. there was no promotion ( a LIE!) 3.they just refuse. Then they ignored me. But luckily, their contractor, flybmi, went bankrupt, so they had to pay me back the whole sum.  It was worth opening champagne!     Extremely long delays with no compensation whatsoever.     Rude staff in Frankfurt,  and very unhelpful .... not again. Lady on the check-in desk B24 real attitude with me and the three travellers in front. She needs a new job!     \"Delays, delays and excuses!\"   Initial delays caused a missed connection from Frankfurt to Rome. After a mad dash through the airport to the gate the had gone despite a large number of passengers transferring onto the  After being rudely told the had gone and we should of been quicker we were redirected to customer service staff. They rebooked us onto another that arrived in Rome after 23.40 and gave us €20 to buy a hot meal for 2 of us whilst stuck in the airport for nearly 7 hours! They also reliably informed us that the train network would still be running when we arrived as we had pre booked tickets for our arrival.  This was also late leaving!  So when we arrived in Italy and made it through to railway station we were surprised to find the next train was not until 6.30am! €48 later and we eventually got to our hotel at 1am losing a whole evening of what was a birthday surprise.  Not surprisingly the return flights were also late returning to the UK.  Customer services have tried to dismiss compensation claims blaming everyone else rather than their poor scheduling!  First and last time use  the that prides themselves on to.e keeping and efficiency. What a joke!     Dresden  Terribly arrogant and incompetent  I was recently treated very disrespectful at the German City Airport Dresden, i.e., Flughafen Dresden check in.  I am a Canadian resident and have a valid work permit along with a valid Passport I was abou to checkin for my final destination Vancouver flying through Seattle (US). There is currently an ETA  (electronic travelling authorization to enter Canada) exemption for travellers with status i.e., work or study permit coming to Canada though a from the US.   I was prohibited from checking in by an extremely rude and arrogant reperesentative at the Airport Dresden when I firmly but politely explained that I do not need such an ETA due to my status. This dark haired mid aged (40s) lady jumped into the conversation that I originally had with the apprentice whose first language was not German and called her next door representative (one counter to her right) for help. After the dark hair lady approached the counter of the apprentice that was abviously overwhelmed with the task I was yelled at \"STREITEN SIE NICHT MIT MIR\" \"DONT ARGUE WITH ME\" !!!!!  Unacceptable     Disgusting Shameful Disrespectful Thats being nice and am I surprised I see 1* overall for this company not at all Stress free? Not at all Been told my question has been answered ha as if it says confirmed and theyre going off on a tangent about schedule change when quite obviously thats the back Quite simply F Off thinking I or anyone else has the time of day and patience to deal with ineptitude of the highest order when it comes to the simplest of questions. Let them know about the review? They wouldnt care anyway, a company confused by this one is in absolute disarray Check in online is a COMPLETE FAILURE     Horrible customer service, they delayed my areival by 21h 25min. They reject my LAWFUL compensation claim blaming the delay on ATC restriction when I have an official document that there were no restriction on the airport!

Totally unacceptable behaviour from  a shocking disregard to customer service.     Higher fares are charged by compared to budget EuroWings. But then they change your planes from bigger plane to smaller plane with no explanation given. Seat that I had booked got changed to a seat right next to the toilet although seat number was the same because plane was changed to smaller one. Airlines should give partial refund if they change the planes at last minute. Plus there was a lot of turbulence on the  This may be due to bad weather not fault. Sandwich and a drink offered on the plane. Cabin crew was friendly and prompt in service. Website is bad and check in process is not very user friendly. Not a very pleasant experience.

When they changed my assigned seat without notice and gave it to someone else and threaten to remove me from the plane if I refused to sit in the middle where the new seat was assigned.   This year, my mom, wanted to visit my brother on the way home, and since my brother lives in Frankfurt, she booked a ticket on  Big mistake.   On international flights, on one of the routes, you are allowed two 23kg luggage and for the rest you have to pay. The information on Luf. website is very confusing, they have routing sections, and numbers but no clear explanation from point A to B. So, I called the customer service number and asked what the cost would be. She took my reservation number, checked the and came back with the quote that it would cost $125.00   Fast forward, at the airport, at the checking counter, looking to checkin the extra bag and we are asked to pay $230. Obv. at this point, there is nothing you can do, except pay. You know how whenever you try to reason with them, they turn into an emotionless parrot, and keep repeating themselves?  It must be some sort of a training and brain-washing techniques that apparently all these companies employees go through. Anyway, there was no reasoning with the parrot, so I paid.   Then I wrote a complaint to Luf. After two weeks of no reply and sending two emails, I got a canned response, this time the parrot could write.:-)   Useless, incompetent people. Now, my mom will never fly Luf.   Keep it up Luf.     Cannot deliver an invoice! After being so picky online while asking for invoicing address (not longer than 25 characters, no punctuation, not this, not that&#8230;) I wasnt able to get a proper invoice with my address and VAT ID on it.

Absolutely bloody useless! representative changed my ticket after I stated no changes were to be made, and then confirmed over the telephone no changes had been made, however, the ticket had been cancelled. then made no attempt to try and help with the getting the ticket reinstated. Requested a manager come to the phone but they are in perpetual meetings, no doubt trying to manage the complaints.     I was pleased with and a fan of the  But recently we had the worst check-in experience ever.  I booked a round by searching based on the origin and the destination indicating my nationality and followed the popped out search results assuming the results were accurate.  I booked a two-hub trip, and evidently, I should have had a Visa for less than two hours layover in a transit   Because of that, I was not allowed to fly and forced to pay three times more for my wife and me to fly the next day. At the same time, there were two more people with the same problem and the staff, and the manager seemed totally familiar with the problem.  It seemed unusual and inferred that knew about the issue and did not prevent it from happening probably for a long time. It bothered me a lot, and I would say might do it intentionally because they offered no solution other than paying more, and such similar cases happen a lot, and many accept the offers like us. Because they dont have any other choices.  I feel it likes taking advantage of the most vulnerable people in their extremely desperate condition and unfair. At least they should let you be refunded. PS: all the personnel and the manager whom I dealt with were polite, helpful, and courteous.  However, when I was standing close to the stand and was extremely exhausted, desperate, and disappointed. One of Lufthansas staff approached and talked to the gentleman who helped me, and I overheard them and thought they were talking about my situation and tried to correct them. Suddenly, she turned to me and aggressively attacked me saying I was not talking to you. I was stunned and tried to explain that I mistakingly overheard them, but she kept coming more aggressively. Considering the situation and the strength of the reaction for such an innocent mistake, It was kind of weird situation, and I was sure when she turned and saw a white man, undoubtedly she would just have ignored it.     Medium During my last trip, the first was late and I lost the second  Due to this fact, they paid the night at a horrible and very bad hotel. There were many bed bugs in this hotel. It was very very bad. :( I dont recommend.     Worst customer service ever.   When confronted with the fact that they are forcing customers to meet extra unnecessary visa requirements for the UAE, they refused to listen. These conditions cause unnecessary stress and cost money. Imagine showing up to to check in for a and being told you have to purchase another that leaves the UAE within 30 days, or they will not let you board! However, according to the UAE government, UK/ Irish citizens can stay for up 40 days (30 days + 10 days grace) and can renew their tourist visas inside the country or by doing a border run on an unlimited basis. Indeed, other major airlines, including the UAEs own airlines, Flydubai, Etihad and Emirates, do not have these extra requirements.   When I tried to expain this to the customer complaints advisors, they were rude, condescending and exceedingly patronising. As a result of this incredibly bad experience, I will never book a with again and I suggest everyone does the same.   This will be my first and last experience with  They obviously do not value their customers! Disgusted.

My husband should had taken this to Munich and then, connect other back to home (Cluj-Napoca, Romania). Next morning, he would had had another to Paris. The passengers were been informed about the cancellation of the right after they arrived at the airport. My husband didnt receive an alternative to arrive home that night, nor to go directly to Paris, where he had had to be the next day. So, that, he missed also the connecting to home, from Munich and also the next day to Paris (that he had booked a few months before). Moreover, did not offered him accommodation, letting him spend the night in the airport. The next morning, he bought, by himself, a ticket to Frankfurt and then to Paris, in order to follow the established schedule. When my husband has sent feedback to  asking for compensation, they refused, saying that the weather conditions were unfavorable.

I have been trying to get in contact with them regarding luggage damaged during a  I have called several times, emailed and used their contact formula on their website but still no feedback from  Its impossible to find an employee that takes their work seriously and provides assistance.   Will use their services again.     I did not want to write this bad review, because my issue with -canceled with upgrade- was solved. Not so quickly but solved in 5 month I got refund. But now I have other matter with them regarding miles. Well, I know it may sound ridiculous after reading here all these dramatic cases with lost luggage and dreadful delay and overbooking, but still. So. I got as usual in the beginning of October or about the newsletter regular one as they send to me last 10 years where was offering me to register for double miles if I fly in October and November 2018 in regards to their 25 years of service. I was happy, because I had booked already one in November and then I had another one unexpectedly also in November. I flew both with business class. And how was my surprise when I got regular miles and not double. So I contacted the services, although they changed their web site and now no one page and especially page with contact us is not responding, by email. They answered me that there was no such campaign whatsoever and they are not aware about it !!!!!It was sounded like I have mental problems- hallucinations probably. Imaginary newsletter !!!! So they offered nothing. At all ! Thieves ! I noticed recently that customer service is absolutely reluctant. They do not care about customers- does not matter who are they- business, senators, corporate. And by the way my refund for canceled I got only because I contacted CEO and Chief Executive of operations, because from customer service nobody replied to me for 1 month at all. I strongly do not recommend .Avoid by all mean !     has really gone down hill especially for customer service. Dont bother phoning their contact centre or e-mailing for help. Feedback functionality seems to be permanently down on the website. I got a lot of standard scripted answers but no help. Very disappointed!     Had flown several times with previously with multiple late and delayed flights. The customer services I recieved was utterly abissmal, whilst the staff I dealt with where friendly they did absolutely nothing to help resolve anything. Had a booked that they cancelled on there system and I was forced to rebuy a ticket at there airport, recieved no communication that my ticket was cancelled by email, would avoid at all costs. Expensive and give worse service then I have ever received on budget airlines, for a far greater price.     Lufthansas \"NEW\" website and shamelessly aggressive-borderline-FORCEFUL attempts to get me to set up a spam-filled iD are TERRIBLE. Who signed off on the design and going live? An intern?!? I cannot access my miles, cannot book any flights. Cannot do anything unless I set up a new iD. And guess what? I cant set up a iD either! Skytrax 5 stars is clearly becoming an increasing JOKE and TOTAL FARCE. When will another enter the German market and put quality back into the flying experience?!     Terrible Customer Service Took payment for 4 tickets from my bank account Would not change one letter on a booking and wanted 25 euro fee was then advised to cancel then the tickets cost more Have had to spend 90 minutes on the phone at 10p a minute Have had to spend at least three hours of my own time  No response to e mail and no mention of any compensation  Bank account is now overdrawn with them double booking tickets  Very dissapointed  Had to phone 3 times before they realised what I was saying was true to then be told after a 60 minute call that I had to to phone technical services. Dont you think you should be phoning the customer. I can not believe that a company as big as do not have a good customer service team How long do you have to wait for your money back I have been waiting 14 days so far and that is only for the first transaction Would love to hear from any other customers who this has happened to. How could you be charged twice over for the tickets you have bought siimply terrible Good at taking your money, however its another story returning it     Terrible customer service First, I was flying with a family member and a lap infant, the seats which were assigned were just random and didnt take into account that we have an infant with us. second, only one meal was provided between Frankfurt and Atlanta (about 10 hours . I had to do some change on the return for a family member, I dealt with the worst customer service in the air flights business, they hung up on me and refuse to be any useful to help with the issues. Also got charged $400 to add an infant lap ticket. Bottom line me and my family will not do business with again, stay away from such terrible customer service     I had the worst experience with which I have never had in my history so far and the incident happed while I was check in, the only thing I was expecting from them was the word \"I/we are sorry\" and I didnt heard that at all... Thank God they are not the only airway flying to Ethiopia and obviously its my fault that I didnt chose this time to fly with Ethiopian Airlines, there is nothing like them.  So, from now on I will say \"No...No\" to  Even if its your personal choice I will not recommend to those I care! #bymysidenotoLufthansa     I flew with them in July and they still havent refunded me the overpayment owed due to travelling with a teenager and them owing me for APD tax and their telephone booking charge. Trying to email or telephone their customer service is difficult as you get fobbed off. Ive gone through Resolver to sort it out but I still havent received my money.     Weve been waiting for a call from a Lufthansas Customer relations team for over 14 days!!!! Our complaint with id 32348829 was raised 2-3 weeks ago.  We received an acknowledgement by someone working at the Customer Relations team- Antony Salazar that we will receive a call and that was the end to it!  There is absolutely no way you could reach a representative of the team nor speak to anyone.  We addressed our complaint to the CEO of the company along with the director of the Customer Relations team, who seem to be absolutely careless!  I am now taking the step to contact the Better Business Bureau, because I cannot believe how disgusting and poor this well know worldwide company is treating its customers!     Ive been asking a simple invoice for 3 months. They replied 2 times after 20 days asking for absurd informations. No invoicing so far, still sending emails.     Unbelievably poor experience for me this morning. HRW to Frankfurt was 1 hour late. Despite the fact that half the people on board the fligh had a connection, the stewardess did neither apologise nor offer any useful application information or offered to liaise with the ground staff. She tried to blame it on Heathrow. The ground staff at Frankfurt nearly closed the gate on me, despite me running all the way to the gate and did not even apologise for the late running of their flights. Delays can happen anywhere but customer service on board or on the ground was lacking. Next time Ill let BA!     I had booked a ticket from Copenhagen->Frankfurt->Marseille and home again via the same airports. After I bought the ticket I found out that I had to fly to another city first so I bought another ticket.   Now Im at Marseille Airport ready to go home. At the check-in desk they told me that my ticket was cancelled because I took another fra Copenhagen and I had to pay 286 euros extra to get home.   Earlier today I tried to check in online but I couldnt so I called their customer service to ask if something was wrong with my ticket. He said it was fine and that I should just check in at the airport.   NOBODY told me my ticket was cancelled. He didnt and they didnt even send an email to inform me about the changes.   This is the worst ever and the worst customer service ever. All in all, I Will NEVER use them again and I will advice everybody I know and everybody who reads this to avoid them.   Just to repeat my advice once more: DO NOT USE THEM!     Very bad behavior by by booking an overseas  .... Before I booked a ticket on-line for my gf that there was a problem as only the title Mrs (which was a mandatory field) could be choose, even she is a Ms! .... they told me twice when I called them about the problem, that it could easily be changed if I called them after the booking had been made ... but when I called them, they told me that it was not possible!!! .. how stupid are you allowed to be!!! told on phone that they would make an internal notice if something should go wrong in the airports she would pass - I asked for an confirmation on Email, but they refused to give me .... so if something should go wrong, they probably dont remember or never said!!!  More stupidiness! I even booked a ticket online and got a booking number and was told I  could pay either on the phone or on homepage. I chose homepage, only realizing that it was mission impossible! ... I called them and told them about the problem,  and they asked me to wait 2 hours, as they needed to do some updating ... When I returned they had meanwhile cancelled the booking  without any notice!!! .... They told me they were sorry, but they couldnt do anything about it, even I had to choose another even it was a far more impropriate ....   I wrote the company 2-3 weeks ago, about both issues, customer.relations @ com , and just get weird/incompetent replies leading nowhere, just saying that some other department shall take care of my complain, but nothing happens .... Update: 13/10- 2018 - this time a very service minded girl at corrected the title of the ticket from Mrs to Ms .. But no response on  the cancel of my booking made by phone with  .. I did get another ticket on-line but it costed my gf 3 hours extra in transit in Frankfurt!  administration, you need to do some improvements on service and bea little more willing to find solutions when you make a failure, and not just say \"we sorry\", but we cant help you .. thats just an immature and not worthy way of responding! ..     is a rotten . no way near premium     Unfortunately I used for 4 flights, all of them were in late and I lost all coincidences with other flights. A really bad experience with a premium company. Easyjet respect better the time it gave to its customer. No more ..     The was late 7 hours. There is no phone for customer service for compensation. It has been 2 months now, sent them multiple emails but no reply. Dont fly with them if you have other options.     Lounge@Frankfult  I had a very uncomfortable experience with  I could not smoothly enter the lounge near B23.  I had a ticket for Air China business class and was qualified to use it. Because the time is early, the ticket counter at the gate (B23) was closed.  She refused me to enter because I have no boarding pass, so I took almost one hour to get out of the airport and re-entered in order to use it.  She seemed that I was not a customer although I paid a lot for  I think that she should be replaced at least, or this should be improved.     The worst company ever they never answered any of my complaints!!!! They are disgusting ...     I flew with twice in life and both times theyve lost the luggage. Customer service is terrible, both on the counter and by phone. Instead of apologizing for theis mistake they were mocking us, on the phone after making me wait 28 minutes they just hung up while I was still talking. Food on board was aweful, the pasta was chewy and smelled terrible and the bread was from at least 2 days before. Ive definitely had much better food with lots of other air companies and I do travel a lot for work and for leasure.  Hostesses and stewards were not up to high standards, Ive asked for a glass of water with no gas and a glass of apple juice and I got 1 glass of half sparkling water and half apple juice. They gave me the vegetarian option that I did not order, it had in fact being ordered by a girl on a totally different row.   I wouldnt again as its expensive but gives the service of a low cost.     Booked family of 4 from Birmingham to Johannesburg via Frankfurt.  did not advise us to bring birth certificate for our 14-year-old daughter (South African immigration requirement).  At the airport they refused to check us in as we did not have this document.  Told us a scan was not acceptable (which is not true).  Tried to obtain the certificate but not in time & missed the   Ground staff couldnt care less & totally unsympathetic - told to contact sales team & ask to transfer flights to following day.  Sales team equally unsympathetic - told us they wouldnt transfer the flights, but invited us to book new one way seats at a cost of GBP6500 (daylight robbery).  In the end we went with Qatar Airways for GBP3900.  On the way back (luckily they saved our return seats) they lost our luggage, which was eventually delivered damaged & 4 days late.  Have reported both these issues twice to their \"comments & complaints\" address & requested compensation - no response from the apart from an automated reference number.  Disgraceful customer service from start to finish from a \"national flagship\"   I hope they go bankrupt & fold.  Will never book with them again.  UPDATE: Got a phone call from  followed by an email.  They stated they would compensate us for the delayed & damaged baggage (received) - & they would also refund us for the missed flights, due to being denied boarding.  No refund has been received.  They also asked me to provide feedback on their response.  Well here it is - youre still a dreadful company.  Dont tell people youre going to refund their money if you have no intention of doing so.  UPDATE: Now taking to small claims court.  We applied to the German arbitration service - stated we received a very small refund for the tickets (another lie - it was for delayed & damaged luggage).  We have email evidence (x2) they agreed to refund the ticket costs (nil received to date, so more lies).  They are now challenging the court case.  A despicable company with zero business ethics or moral conscience.     Customer relations are appalling,they dont answer the phones for days and when you finally do speak to a member of staff they have not got a clue. I arrived at Heathrow airport on 14th August 2018 and my baggage was missing, 14 days later still no baggage, no response from and unable to speak to anyone on the phone as they do not answer calls. I will NEVER use this again. One star is a gross over exaggeration!     Had to return home early from Moldova-my mother-in-law died unexpectedly. Would have paid for date changes on my tickets, but both  and Expedia shocking to deal with. Dont believe either have a customer service team. Shame on both. Would have awarded nil stars if an option. Recommend avoid them both if at all possible.     I had a lost baggage flying in from Frankfurt to Toronto and they were supposed to deliver the baggage next day. Neither have they delivered nor does anyone pick up the phone at the number given. Have very important documents and goods. Unacceptable customer service.     The 2 of August I purchased a ticket for Toulouse. There were made two charges on my account (2 x about 220€) and Ive called them 3 times, emailed customer relations and no one gets back or helps with this problem. They also want me to pay for a phone call to Germany, to have them help me, even though I am the one who have done nothing wrong....     Cancelled my a few hours before we were due to leave and a host of other disasters. Emailed them 16 days ago about my (legally entitled to) compensation and had zero response. Social media is ignored or generic response. We were flying for a wedding and all the guests flying by had issues- cancelled or delayed flights, lost luggage, damaged luggage etc. Choose any other      In November 2017 we booked 4 flights, 2 connecting flights each way to our holiday destination, via Munich. We discovered online in Mayy 2018, purely by chance and one month before departure, that had cancelled all 4 flights. They had not notified us or refunded our payment. Furious, I phoned them to be told \"the refund will arrive in 7 days\". It did not, it took 2 weeks, after chasing further. would not, or could not, tell me at what point they had cancelled the flights after accepting payment for the booking in November 2017. They had kept our payment for over 5 months. We then had to find fresh flights which caused stress, further expense and much longer travel arrangements to and from (different) inconvenient airports.     If you have baggage and a connecting with forget it. The baggage will miss the connecting  deliver it damaged and then force you to send them more than 5 emails in order to review your demand for compensation. Classic  Even Ryanair tops out this so-called \"company\".     employer helped me when Brussels airlines got me stranded in Frankfurt. I had a terrible day with delayed flights and zero info and I was denied to board the last plane home bc Brussels airlines screwed up. So I went to the help desk and even though Brussels airlines and doesnt have a contract they helped me get on the first in the morning and also one night at a hotel. Really good service from that guy.  And they have also always been friendly when flying with      I had booked a return ticket from Pune>Malta>Pune, via Frankfurt. Had to reschedule the return ticket so paid GBP 364.06  to change the date. Had an email from them to say itinerary has been changed and my from Malta has been rescheduled to leave much earlier in the day as a result of which I will miss the connection from Frankfurt to Pune. I have written several mails and called them twice. They said they will refund that leg of the ticket but not rescheduling charges of GBP 364.06. I have asked them refund this too as they are not able to provide the service I paid for and I am rightly entitled to a full refund including rescheduling. They wrote back saying customer service will contact me. Nothing so far and it has been over three weeks. Very poor customer service of such a reputed  Will never fly with them again. I am considering taking them to court.     Trying to book a online on com is one of the worst customer experience i ever had! and at the end it didn´t work.     Reference Number: NYRDCE  I booked a through Gotogate early May this year of £987.00 but later cancelled due to medical reasons. Despite paying a cancelation fee of £75.00 and providing a medical note, I have still not received my refund. Its been three months and every phone call is received with chains of excuses and I feel like I am being deceived.  I was meant to fly with on this trip. Gotogate informed me that my refund will be paid by  however I was told in a few days that have refused to pay the refund.  I will like to hear from on this issue and reasons for refusing to refund.     Still missing our luggage after 8 days.  No answer to our phonecalls and emails. Just unuseful answers at Lufthansas facebook, where they recommend us to call and mail the unresponsive numbers/mailadresses.     Putting a demand for reimbursement after downgrade, they answered that they have forwarded the topic internally. 4 Month ago, reminder sent, nothing heard. I will try to fly other airlines.     Poorly, poorly handling of the whole incident i Munich Airport Saturday 28-JUL-2018, leaving all the passengers with a bad, bad experience. They don´t step up, and they don´t do their utmost to solve all the consequences. It was, and still is, clear to everybody that an incident like the one i Munich airport has never been on the agenda for the company, and therefore they didn´t know what to do. Chaos! Armageddon! No plans for crisis handling, no plans for dealing with this amount of stranded passengers and luggage. What have their being doing in executive management of ? Nothing, I guess. Shame on You, CEO of   No further words needed. Cannot recommend this company. Never fly again     Awful experience, delayed causing my Transit to have a shorter window. Apparently the thought there was no need to delay the to LHR. We then had to run in 8 mins after our landed, a usual 45 min walk (from Gate I in Munich to Gate L15). if that was not enough, we have now lost baggage, with NO contact from the  and even did not have the audacity to be able to give us a correct phone number that we can contact someone about this.   I think the most disappointed thing about this service is the fact that this can so happily take money from us, so quickly and give us such a horrific experience in return, without an apology and a working telephone line to speak to someone about the baggage and to complain!   not only would i never use this again, but i will go actively out of my way to encourage others not to even consider them.   Look forward to someone to contact me about my lost luggage, look forward to my £6,000 cheque if not. My regular panic attacks and vomiting will hopefully subside with this anxiety I have had from this lost luggage - no guarantee. Better lawyer up.     My son (8) flew from London Heathrow to Munich. Minor thing at the airport, i asked whether we queue in the normal place for unaccompanied minors and one person said yes. The second took us straight to a counter to be processed... so something is inconsistent or not well enough defined in their process here.   Anyway, next we send kid off with the other unaccompanied minors and all seems good. It kinda sucks that there is no service here to confirm when he gets on the plane / that he has left on board the plane unless you... actually, turns out there isnt anybody you can contact.  On the other end, my son arrived and in Germany the passengers are normally out of the airport within around 30 minutes. After an hour we started to get worried. After an hour and a half we started making calls, only to find out how BAD this all was. The grandparents waiting for my son were nearly the only people left waiting, and they saw all other people from the same come out and leave (yes they asked some people if they were on the same . Calling Lufthansas service number, they tell me theyll give me the relevant number to track down where my child is. 5 Minutes later they confirm that number is no longer available. They give me a number for the baggage department, but i think they gave me the internal code rather than a proper phone number, as we couldnt work out the right digits to make it work (tried variations adding country / city codes). In the meantime, my wife called the number on the GERMAN website which called the main reception for the airport. They immediately complained they dont work for  but we simply explained how we had lost our child and nobody was able to tell us where he was. They put us through to more people who possibly could have told us the right information however, just at this point my son finally emerged.  It doesnt actually get any better from here. My son was late out because his suitcase was missing. Even though they have our phone numbers, apparently they never thought to just give us a heads up that he was being held up as his bag was missing. They eventually worked out it was still in London... apparently. After being told the suitcase would arrive next day, that was that. The next day, calling back we are given a reference, but the system shows that the bag still hasnt been found. Now were on Monday, 3rd day after the and there is still no sign of the bag.  So to summarise: * Unaccompanied minors cannot be tracked with  They have no number to call to check where your kid is. * They do not let you know when they have delays getting through the checkpoints in the destination country * If they lose your bag, they will either lie... or simply lose your bag again before it gets delivered. Who knows which.     Totally waste of time on their website As soon as you are about to pay, technical problems will appear and you have to start fram the beginning, and this time pieces are gone up Dirty old trick Not cool  not cool Trump is more trust-able then you     I am currently trying to travel from Amsterdam to Gaborone. Yesterday our was delayed from Amsterdam to Munich by  Due to this delay We missed our South African Airways and were left stranded in Munich. Step by step this is what has happened so far and it should tell you of how your employees and protocols for this situation are appalling  1) We arrived at 2130 and immediately joined the line at the service point 2) At 0100 I was told I cannot be rebooked and it will only be done at 0400am I was denied any accommodation. I also rejoined the line for service at 0400am. I was not given anywhere to sleep I just sat in line for another 9 hours 3) At 0930 I finally got service and was rebooked to fly to Frankfurt then Windhoek Then Gaborone to arrive Monday a day later. I flew out of Munich at 11am and arrived at 1200. We immediately went to the next service station and asked them for accommodation again so we can bath and refresh after 24hrs without sleep or a bath. They denied us this and instead gave us 6 Euro voucher for a public restroom shower.  4) When I got to the shower the service lady said she does not accept these vouchers. Since I was already out of customs I had to go to the check in gate, the lady helping me was supposed to be the suppervisor there but she was incredibly rude nd said she does not have the time to help me find a shower and I should realise she is busy. all she did was write her cell phone and asked me to return to the public restroom and give it to the lady. I did that, the lady again said she cannot help, tried to call but the number was not going through.  5) I then walked to the international side of Frankfurt airport and found out that       a) I cannot check in because since rebooked on our behalf there are \"issues with the booking\" and also b) they did not print out boarding passes   so currently I am stuck at the departures check in kiosk, waiting for Air Namibia to open (only opens 2 hrs before the  our is at 20:10 and so i will be waiting here on a bench for 5 more hours, no sleep, no bath for 48 hrs and seems not to care that they should help me. I am a black African woman and I cant help but think I have been treated like an animal due to racist ideology. Other people have had accommodation and trains organised for them, they have been given vouchers that actually work they have been given better care than us and I want to know why that is?     I hate this  This is the second time now they have messed us around and ruined our holiday. They have cancelled our and weve had to fight for them to give us a replacement  which is 12 hours later and includes a 12 hour stop over (which wasnt included in the original itenary). Weve lost a night in our villa now. Gutted. Please, do yourselves a favour and choose another      My parents were traveling home from the US, theyve just bought a new suitcase as a gift, and by the time they landed in Hungary, and got their luggages back, this new one was damaged.  We immediately contacted and also asked for instructions at the airport, but they told us only is in charge, since it was on their when it happened. We wrote numerous emails, called them, and waited patiently. Every single time we wrote they either told us, they were dealing with inquires or ignored my emails completely.  Its been over 3 years, my damaged luggage still awaiting repair or a change, and Im guessing is still dealing with lots of inquires..     Last year at the end of March, my from Frankfurt to Rio was cancelled due to a broken door. When I applied for compensation, claimed that this was a force majeure. I repeat; they believe that not maintaining their planes is a force majeure.  I then took my claim to AirHelp who brought a case on my behalf and won on December 11th last year. In other words, lied about the force majeure (its hard to believe they seriously thought theyd win the case if one was brought)  I still havent received the compensation though. More than six months later, after a lost appeal, still hasnt paid the money they owe me. I have absolutely no reason not to believe AirHelp when they say is dragging their feet.  I just wanted to post this as a warning to other travellers. If tells you that you are not eligible for compensation, DO NOT EVER UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES BELIEVE THEM. Assume they are lying - because thats what they do - and take your case to AirHelp or a similar company. File a complaint with the relevant national/EU authorities too.  You may never get your money back, because not paying what they owe is what does, but at least the company will have to pay for a court case.  Oh, and my parents had a similar experience where claimed that a bird flying in to the engine was a force majeure. They didnt seek compensation, which of course is why LIES... it pays off.  Finally, next time there is an election for the European Parlament, you could petition your local MEPs to remove airlines right to adjudicate compensation claims themselves and introduce fines for the airlines if they dont pay compensation promptly. Because lies and will always act in bad faith.     DO NOT USE THIS CRAP !!! Worst experience in 40 years of travel , a 7 hour journey U.K.  Frankfurt onward to Beirut took 37 hours , they lost my baggage on the way &#128545; retrieved it but refused to deliver in Lebanon , on return to U.K. they again lost my luggage &#128545;&#128545; in fact my work kit !!! That was on the 24th June , I still dont have it 27th !! The customer service is a joke taking 30 mins to answer the phone or 2 weeks to answer emails !! They have refused to compensate us and denied the luggage was lost and said there is no luggage report on it , which there is ! Dealing with customer service is beyond frustrating &#128545; they leave you on hold after talking to you giving generic answers like robots for 20-30 mins plus in the end you hang up and then have to call back and start all over again ,  crazy , I HATE THEM , avoid them if you have any sense     You do not get what you pay for  Premium Economy Class Complaint - My from Barcelona to Frankfurt in May 2018 was delayed and I was not able to take the connecting from Frankfurt to Houston on my pre-booked Premium Economy class. asked me to change the and rebooked me other with economy class. I had no choice but took it.  By doing that, I lost the privilege of the services of Premium Economy. I purchased the more expensive Premium Economy ticket with and yet was downgraded to a less expensive economy class. After the trip, I contacted and they refused any compensation associated with this trip.  This is an extremely bad experience with  For those purchasing Premium Economy Class from needs to prepare one day that they will have a chance to be downgraded to economy when there is a delay of the that is not the passengers fault. It is not worth the money to purchase Premium Economy Class since you spend the money but you may not be able to have the services of Premium Economy Class when there is a delay in that is not the passengers fault.     I was supposed to fly out on December 3rd to go from Turin to Amsterdam but was for some reason not allowed on that  I was told to step aside as the lady at the check-in checked in other persons on that  I waited there for half an hour while she did nothing for me and I had no idea why. When she realized she had made the mistake of doing that she proceeded to give me the excuse the had too much fuel and could not have other people on the  Never the less, I was put up in Turin for the night, the next day the was delayed by over 2 hours.  I then sent them an email voicing the situation and they had promised me 250 Euro in compensation. I have not received payment and it has been 6 months since I was told it would be transferred. I have called customer service over 6 times and every time I call I am given a new excuse as to why the repayment hasnt been transferred. Quite frankly the worst service I have ever received especially from such a well-known  Will never fly with them again and would give 0 stars if I could.  Edit. They ended up paying compensation but it took way too long. They have now earned their 1 star     Not worth the price. Theyre not going to be any more or less in time than anyone else, yet they claim to be. Rather use low cost airlines that are exactly as cheap and worthless as      My Husband is currently stranded in Frankfurt....He should have been home in the UK by now and this is the return journey...the outward journey he spent the night on the airport floor after delays and an eventual cancellation. I wont even go into the appalling Customer service. If you think Ryanair and Easyjet area bunch of clueless crooks, I can tell you, they ve got nothing on these guys! If you have any other option at all do not fly with these people!     I would give 0 stars, but you have to click at least 1... We used to fly at least once a month from London to Turkey, but after this experience will never use them again. Worst customer service Ive ever had to deal with in my life - rivalling Vodafone! cancelled our 12 hours before my grandma and I were due to travel and gave no explanation at all, not even days later. Their suggestion in this situation is to call their Service Desk, so we did. Despite being told my wait time would be 10 seconds, I waited for over half an hour the first time I called. I wouldnt have minded as much if they didnt charge 40p per minute to call them... Sidenote: The holding message tells you that you can quickly and easily check-in/manage your booking online. You just about can, but it would seem a PhD is required to be able to navigate their website. The outcome of the first call was that they put us on the same time one day later, but offered no compensation for reducing our long weekend by one day. The next day we tried to check-in again but the website was still showing our old details - turns out the incompetent Service Desk staff didnt click Confirm in their tool when changing our flights. So I called them back and this time was on hold for 20 minutes, again at 40p per minute, all because of their mistake. This time they confirmed the change and told us to try checking in again. We went to check-in and discovered that theyd put me and my grandma on different flights! So we called back a 3rd time and asked to be put straight through to a manager as wed had enough. Apparently there were no supervisors available, so the call agent updated our flights but said wed still need to check-in ourselves. At the end of the call, I asked to make a formal complaint as I expected them to at least reimburse me for the minutes Id spent on the phone because of them, as well as some form of compensation for messing us around. But they said theyd have to put me through to the Customer Relations department for that. After being put on hold for a further 30 minutes, I got through to \"customer service\" who clearly couldnt have cared less and said there was nothing they could do for us. Not even a half-hearted apology or attempt at a goodwill gesture. They even tried to refer us back to the bookings team to see if we could ask for an upgrade - tried that already thanks and got sent to you. All in all a dreadful experience, waste of my life and disappointing treatment from an we frequently flew with. Emphasis on the past tense.     There isnt really anything good to say about  their customer service is total trash! I have been waiting for an hour on the phone to cancel my booking. Then they tell me to do it online and that I will be refunded! However, when I log on to cancel I am told that this is in no way possible and that I have to do it by phone! So here I am on my second attempt to reach them (again waiting for over an hour) to cancel my booking...    I will never in my life book by again! Total trash and the personal is arrogant as can be! I speak English perfectly, however, the woman I was speaking to kept saying Sorry madam, we only speak English in the most broken English I have ever heard!     nothing special with this company, just transport from a to b     I was running behind schedule but arrived at the airport in time to make it through security. LH told me I wouldnt get on the and to pay for a new set of tickets including penalty. They wanted me to spend nearly 400£. I cant afford that and bought a late night ticket (the only option I could afford). Before I realized I could have made my original  they had already charged me. I could have made it but they swindled me into spending more money and overreacting like Ive made the worst mistake of my life.   I booked with the LH site and the lady at the ticket counter implied because my ticket was purchased in the UK that I could just rebook my without payment. She lied and I feel cheated. I booked with LH because theyre star alliance but Ive learned my lesson and look forward to actively avoiding this company. Im literally sitting at the airport bawling my eyes out because of how much money theyre bathing me.  They charge you extra on the return too even though you havent missed that.     Poor customer service and interaction. They suddenly cancelled my and did not rebook or shown other options. Ruined my anniversary and other travel plans. Money not refunded too very bad airlines to fly. Dont why people treat it as a top airlines.     I booked a from Germany to Los Angeles around 6 months ago and in mid March paid $700 (2 tickets) to be upgraded to premium economy for couple of weeks their website showed our status as premium economy. We went to our vacation and last day of our vacation we got an email for confirmation and in that our seats were regular economy, baffled that we had paid for this upgrade a month in advance why suddenly the change so we called the customer service and 45 minuets hold the lady said due to \"equipment change!!!!!\" This problem has happened and \"unfortunately there is no availability for this class\" and they will refund my money in 10 days.  So we went to airport but this time instead of asking what happened we just asked do you have availability for premium economy they lady looked and said they have!!!! In result we said so because we have paid in advance we want those seats she got so surprised that had to call her boss. The boss guy came and said \"you asked if the seats are available but not you paid already\". Anyway they were caught red handed and had to give us the tickets.  My issue is this company is committing a fraud either: 1.  Sold us a product that later claimed they dont have and kept our money for 1.5 months without bothering to let us know Or  2. They had the seats available but towards getting close to date sold or seats to a higher price.  Either way they are fraudulent, liar, and untrustworthy.     To cut it short, I booked 2 flights for almost 200 quid (short European flights). One was cancelled, & I had to re-book that (plus transport) at my own expense, and the second went ahead and all was fine. After 40 minutes + on the phone with customer service, I am told that the fee I paid is the same regardless of how much I get out of it. Thats all.  I tried to argue using logic: if you pay for two apples and you get one, then obviously the customer is not happy. Especially as we are talking about an expensive and respected company: \"Thats the policy, maam, sorry\". The second issue I have is with how they communicated my cancelled  the email said there were changes to my and then displayed the details of my return  No mention of the first journey: I imagined they must have delayed the return by a few minutes - this happens frequently on my budget flights. So I discovered the cancellation very late. As a frequent flyer for the past 8 years, it is the first time I booked a non-budget and the first time I get a negative experience with a booking. I might be just unlucky, but what does one do when one cannot recover valuable money? Not much apart from writing an upset review!     Totally shambolic, albeit expensive,  Sheisse! staff in Kyiv (Ukraine) was trying to deny my boarding by lying and using false pretence, and they only gave leave to enter the aircraft after I had informed them of potential media storm covering the incident. Shambolic experience! No one has come forward to apologise. Restructure the      I once held status because I travelled a lot with them but customer service & quality went down considerably and I only fly LH these days if theres no other convenient option in terms of route.  Having said that, even with the few flights every year now I seem to encounter issues with pretty much every  When you contact customer service it takes about 3 - 4 months to hear back from them. And even then you feel they just want to brush you off as quickly as possible even though they messed up in the first place. I havent even received the final compensation from the previous cancellation, I have already submitted my next one. And Im not expecting any answer for at least 3 months. Sad, really.   On top of that I made a mistake by sending the wrong compensation details (mix up with my different account numbers and sort codes) and I contacted them asking for help to retrieve my compensation. Zero interest to help me out. Not sure why I expected help when I screwed up when they barely bother assisting you when they screw up.  As a customer of LH for many years I have never felt appreciated. Im just a cash machine for them. It is a terrible company.   Just go on Twitter and search all the issues they are causing their customers or read through the reviews here and see for yourself.   If you can book a different  do so. Avoid      cancelled and rebooking for a 4 days after. 4 days!!!! And customer service agent was so rude and unhelpful. I am appauled by the service. Do not ever chose its the worst.     Wow, You thought EasyJet was bad. They cancelled and left €200+ out of pocket and never ever responded. Just one automated email about increased load. That was 2 months ago. No words. Worst ever.     I bought my tickets at the end of February 2018 and they have taken my money.  It was online.  Im still waiting for my tickets to be issued despite me sending 2 emails to customer service with NO RESPONSE     delayed 10hr, went to the customer service. Rude staff informated me the compamy cannot offer me anything ( ask me to sleep at the gate, given me pillow and blanket). then i read the passgner right on the company website, stated i have right to ask for hotel, food and transport, so i went back to the same service  counter. and the other staff gave me vocher for hotel, food right away.  i dont feel comfortable with how they treated me. i also felt discriminated as asian passenger!  really disappointing , bad service for such a company     I made the mistake of Flying with  and its a mistake Ill never make again. You guys seriously suck.   THE  Uncomfortable, food was horrible, drinks were tiny and only allowed one.  The seats felt like concrete, mine was broken and didnt go back so I was upright the entire time and its not even a height issue, Im an average height guy but my knees were pressed against the seat in front of me, my back was hurting and it wasnt just me, other passengers were complaining and limping as we were walking towards arrivals.  The food was disgusting, the bread was stale and chewy. The first stank the entire way of sewage any time anyone used the toilet that was about 10 rows away from me. Me and several other passengers all noticed this and it was a horrible musky gagging smell which really made me dread the home. Have you guys maybe considered maintaining your planes at all? Might help a bit with customer satisfaction.   What initially made me chose over the other options was the fact that if I paid for my baggage online, id get a good discount (all options were paid baggage unfortunately). So I thought thats a good deal.. when really it was just a massive lie. I tried time and time again to add my luggage to my order to get the fee down with no avail, I tried different cards, different devices (PC, Laptop, Phone), I tried at work, at my friends house and every single time Id click Pay it would either loop back round to payment entry with no error message at all or it would bring up a blank page with \"Notice\" at the top with no notice at all. I contact support twice and got no response. Live chat seems to always be offline or busy. So, with no time left I was forced to pay nearly double at the airport or not take any luggage.  The same issues while I was on Holiday. Couldnt add luggage for my return either. I tried calling their local support who were either rude or just hung up on me, sometimes even before the call was put through to someone.   TL;DR: Dont bother, safe yourself the stress/hassle and fly with someone else. dont care about you or your satisfaction, they just was to reel in as much money as they can by paying little on plane maintenance and using deceitful lies to trick you into flying with them.     Absolute nightmare of a company. Forget its a German company, forget the own half of Europe airways, forget about any expectations from even a small western company... This company has no interest in offering any support, customer services or refunds. NO REFUNDS from a regular booking of a scheduled  Took me 25 minutes to understand the person has absolutely no interest in providing any solutions, assistance or support. Cancelled a 3 days after booking it, with 2 weeks to go before the  They offered a link from the confirmation email, clicked on that to go online and be offered another button to click named \"refund/ cancel  and within seconds it has been done. Only when called to verify was I told no way would I receive any refunds (only taxes). when asked to reinstate the booking I have been denied of that as well. All in the name of the blessed Terms and Conditions I have confirmed when booked the originally.  Call another department and was address automatically to an online service and call hung up. Called again and spoke to a poor woman at the Philippines who had no idea what to do and how to do it. Eventually we went for a complaint... whom to? IT department... What do they have to do with that?! Another complaint had to be registered for the booking department. When would I get a response back? no idea.. Its an internal issue. But I am the client and I am external.... No. Following another 20 minutes with a supervisor revealed 3-4 weeks... Probably just made that on the spot. 4 week to wait and my potential is in 2 weeks.  They are so bad even a charter Romanian airlines shone in comparison. Horrific experience, never ever buy from them no matter what or youd bitterly regret it!  AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL!     Cancelled and Customer Service hangs up on me! Dreadful Money hungry company!     Our luggage was lost by after we were redirected with them for my 40th birthday trip to New York. They managed to split mine and my wifes luggage and subsequently only my luggage was located and returned a week later to our home address. We had no clothes so had to buy replacements including a make-up for my wife and a phone charger so that we could contact whilst in New York. The communication was non-existent and it was only when we got back to the UK that we were able to raise a complaint after being told it was our responsibility to contact a courier company in Queens to forward our cases onwards. Since we have raised a complaint we have chased weekly but had one email confirming they had received our complaint. The other week, a month and a half after my wifes case had gone missing i eventually received a cal to say we would be reimbursed for the items we bought in New York and for 50% of the items value in the missing case as we did not have receipts for replacements. Obviously my wife did not want to replace absolutely everything as wed hoped the case would be returned and she we would end up essentially with duplicate items. There were GHD straighteners plus some perfume my wife bought 4 years ago (in NY) that hadnt been replaced. Also, the items my wife did replace she ordered online and only had order confirmations, no receipts so have refused to reimburse the full cost without receipts. We feel as though the service has been non-existent and now, in the 11th hour, were being offered only 50% of reimbursement money and no money at all for compensation for the upset, stress and inconvenience all this has caused us.     Horrible customer service by at Frankfurt Airport. Rude, condescending check-in lady with a bad attitude, employees at the service desk at aforementioned airport with equally bad attitudes, and completely unhelpful. Two stars because the flights were on-time, and they were clean. OK food.     sucs - lousy service - list the luggage i Frankfurt  - deliverede  torino (destination) nemt day - they wint deliver to the hotel - se i t last in airport or at the currier.   Thats german efficiency !!!     Horrible Service. My luggage has now been gone for 5 weeks. I have sent dozens of emails to customer relations (only auto replies received back), called them several times with promises of them getting back to me, and still nothing.  I have NEVER experienced this bad service. Their planes are nice, but everything that happens before and after your with is horribly unprofessional. We will never fly either private or corporate with them again, and have made sure nobody from the company will either.     The worst customer service ever. I posted a complaint September 25. 2017. I have posted several mail to during this period of time NO response except an auto reply that tells med that got so many complaints that they never now when they will respond. HERE IS MY STORY: Traveled with LH 0860 sept 24. 2017. Departure 10.00 from Frankfurt to Oslo. I booked two roundtrip tickets from Oslo- Frankfurt on the sept 20. 2017 with return ticket Frankfurt &#8211; Oslo on sept 24th. 2017. I booked the flights the 14.11.2016 on tripair.com and got the booking number: 7QJ84I E- ticket number: 2201136229278- 2201136229275  Meanwhile I got assigned for a seminar in Malaga- Spain witch intruded with the dates I had booked in Frankfurt. But I found out that I could fly from Malaga to Frankfurt on the 21.th of September. And meet my friend there. When my friend flew from Oslo with to Frankfurt the 20th of September he brought my suitcase with him and tried to check in the suitcase. He was told that he must pay 90 EURO since he had not paid for any luggage in advance. He told the clerk that I (who was in Malaga) would not fly, and that one luggage was paid for in advance on my ticket. But the clerk was firm and told him that even though I was not flying, my friend had to pay for the luggage anyways.  A very rigid and strange policy from a customer point of view. But things where bound to get worse. On Sept. 24th. we where both leaving from Frankfurt with LH 0860. A big surprise waited when I tried to get my boarding pass. I was told that my ticket was \"out of sequence\" and where cancelled by  I asked why, and the clerk told me that since I didnt fly the first from Oslo to Frankfurt, assumed that I didnt want to fly back either?? I got no information whatsoever that my return tickets were cancelled by  Even though had both my phone number and email address. I first thought that this must be a practical joke? But no- I had to pay 250 EUR for a new ticket. After spending more then 20 minutes waiting for the clerk to register everything I finally got my boarding pass. We went downstairs to check in our luggage (the suitcase witch my friend had to payd 900 kr. for in Oslo) But a new surprise. The new boarding card had no extra luggage registered? This time I was present and the clerk could not say that I was not flying, but now claimed that I never had booked with extra luggage?? (but when checked my ticket in Oslo on the 20th I was registered with luggage)  So another 30 EURO must be paid to get the suitcase to Oslo. I have spent 370 EURO extra, plus the 150 EURO I paid for the trip in the first place.  I have never ever experienced all my flying life a more rigid and customer unfriendly system then what practice. owe me and explanation and compensation.  This will be a top story for the Press and social media.     Absolutely shocking customer service. Put in a complaint early December and nearly 2 months on it has not been fully addressed/resolved, with very limited responses to several e-mails. Cancelled a in November a month after booking and charged about 2/3 of price, with 4 months left before the concerned. Simply asked how this has tied in with terms of business? when the terms were advised? as nothing apparent in the booking documentation and how the charges were calculated? But unfortunately this simple question cannot be answered. The cancellation charge was given and thats all, even this was difficult to understand.  Cant believe this is a so called flagship with such poor service and unfortunate that this will need to be pursued through the regulator to get an answer.  Id avoid if you can based on my experience and the reviews on here.     Worst experience ever&#8230; from beginning to end  Never expected that one of the most reputable air companies can perform so pathetically.   I am a frequent traveler to Japan (from London) and used a great variety of air companies like KLM, Finnair, AirFrance, AirChina, Malaysia Airlines, British Airways, Singapore Airlines etc. and never had any issues with them. This time I tried and received an extremely unpleasant experience that jumps out from the level of service provided by other mentioned companies. 1. Not a single (London-Frankfurt-Osaka and return) departed on time causing severe delays during my journey! 2. Worst in-meal service I have ever seen; 3. Non-existing customer services (no response followed to my official complaint ID 31531519 regarding the disruption of my journey).  More than that, in contrast to other European air companies that have frequent connections to London (i.e. KLM) it looks like tries to save money by cancelling partially booked flights and putting everybody on the last on the day. I had that experience in Frankfurt when two Frankfurt &#8211; London flights were cancelled (for no reason) and everybody was invited on the latest in the evening.  Due to zero response from the customer services (it was the last drop) I will make sure to avoid this company at all costs in the future and will advise to do the same to everybody.     Will give it no star if there was an option. It was our first time booking with bravofly but not our first flying with   my husband and I were traumatized the whole journey, because of different airlines policies, we had a big problem checking our luggage (kg|lbs and cabin luggage), plus the transfer is unbelievably short! Will never book again online!! We were expecting a smooth and exciting journey as we are getting married abroad but they just gave us a headache and stress!!! Never again! Do not book a connecting around China! Bad service they do not how to explain  English very well! We were back and forth hundred times (not exaggerating) for 15 mins trying to find our transfer desk!( I dont understand why the transfer desk is 1km away from the gate when we only have 20 mins before boarding!  We were very tired and it was very Stressful running the whole journey!!!  gave us wrong luggage information, they said our hold luggage will be directly going to our destination, only to find out that our hold luggage is in China (connecting  good Lord, one of the passengers told us to check again in baggage claim, if not ALL OUR WEDDING STUFF WILL BE LOST and we will have a very stressful wedding! AIRLINES, whats happening, you used to be one of the best! will never fly with AIRLINES AGAIN!  Same happens with my parents flying with  their was cancelled and they send them to JAPAN for a day, Thank God it was few days before the wedding!     Ive given up any hope that their non-existent customer-care would improve over time.  For business reasons and due to missing alternatives, I have had about 1000 flights with \" in the past 11 years within Europe. They cancel flights without explanation. If at all, they only offer a link in the SMS they usually send (woe if youre out of battery!) to find a solution. These links are usually not existent or not yet existent when you click them. Trying to call a hotline is in case of canceled useless as the answering machine only tells you, that \"due to an unexpected rising of calls\" you should call later, and thats it.   As you get the cancellation mostly just a very few hours before, there is usually not much time to rebook and thus a \"call  later\" is just a barefacedness beyond compare. And in face of cancellations its simply impertinent to claim \"an unexpected rising of calls\" .  If youre lucky, you get some hotline person which is hard to understand. If you like English with Indian pronunciation or German with Romanian accent, well. But I dont. The call-centers are somewhere between Dublin and  Bucharest and such it sounds. The girls and boys do their best but apparently just wants to present an alibi-help-desk and does in fact not care at all, as long as in the main they save money - on the costs of their passengers and I guess on the cost of the hotline-people as well.  My last refund-claim took 106 (onehundertandsix) (!) days to get an answer which was basically that the was canceled due to acts of God and thus I was not entitled for a refund.  Is sued them and won &#8211; after one and a half year..  They even worse lie at the customers concerning the reasons for the cancellations or for being late: The weather is usually the culprit, or they argue that a technical fault is not a reason for a refund (which is a lie).  Rough luck for them that I am a (private) pilot myself and can read METAR and TAF messages (which tell you the official aviation weather).   But it seems that they are successful with this evidently intended strategy of misinformation: By shamelessly lying at the people, they simply quash 80% of all claims beforehand, block another 15% by just not answering refund requests and fight the remaining 5% until you really sue them. It finally pays for them.   And the prices are beyond good and evil. Wherever I look after more than 1000 flights I only see shabbiness at its worse. Its not about the customers, its simply about money.  For  it seems, that flying could be so wonderful - without passengers.  They recently got a five-star ranking as a \"premium-. I have looked into this, and after all, there doesnt seem to be any transparent assessment procedure of that private company they got these five stars from. It is a known fact that this award costs money for the  Or, to put it simpler: I dont know what they payed for this decoration.  I consider it embarrassing and shameful that they hype this award so much, that it just seems like having no other shininess to present. What a ridiculous staginess.  So as a German, my name for them is \"Die Lufthansels\". Which roughly reads like   \"The Wannabee- \"The Lemon-Hansa\" \"The Non-Starters\" \"Lamehansa\"     Flew Manchester - Frankfurt - Istanbul - Frankfurt - Manchester in Business Class and it was shockingly poor.  Business class check-in at Manchester was unmanned and we were left to wait for almost ten minutes until an economy desk was became available as both were checking in two large families.  The Business desk was never manned during our wait.  Despite numerous Group and Star Alliance member flights from Terminal 1 at Manchester, use a very basic lounge, which anyone can pay to access.  The lounge was full with many people knocking back the alcohol at 07:00 and breakfast dishes ran to just watery scrambled eggs and bread rolls during our brief visit as everything else had been devoured.  We left after 10 minutes.   MAN - FRA  Fight delayed by 50 minutes without announcements, explanation or apology.   We were seated in the bulkhead Row 1, which along with the exit rows, are the only rows with additional legroom over the standard seat pitch, which is the same pitch for business class and economy.   Breakfast consisted of a small piece of cheese, two small strips of dried ham, small yogurt and a dry croissant.  Very disappointing for a 1h:50 sector given the lack of lounge catering and the fact that BA serve a Full English with Champagne on a 50m sector such as MAN-LHR.  FRA - IST  Pleasant staff.   do not serve champagne in short-haul business class!  We were seated in Row 2 of business class AKA economy and at 63\", which is nothing unusual in Germany,  I was unable to lower the table to eat my meal as the supports for the table lower right on to your legs, resulting in the table being angled at around 180°, which is just unbelievable for a business class product.   I had to eat my three course meal with my legs painfully splayed into the aisle and the foot area of the middle seat in order to lower the table sufficiently to est, which was made even more difficult by several passengers from the economy cabin stood in the aisle waiting to use the lavatory, which is meant to be for the business cabin only.  Despite staff trying to conduct the lunch service, they made zero attempt to direct the passengers to the rear lavatories.   FRA-MAN This was a late 22:30 departure and the entire cabin were served........a single dish of cold cauliflower, carrots and lettuce with a dressing and a stale pretzel roll.  This was not a special meal and I didnt see anyone eating the dish for obvious reasons.  Dreadful!  Overall I wouldnt give short-haul business class a single star due to the extremely limited legroom from row 2 back, which can even limit your use of the tray table, and the totally abysmal catering, portion sizes and lack of champagne.  Save your money and fly economy where you will enjoy the exact same thinly padded space saver seat, same restricted seat pitch, the same lavatories, the same bar service (minus warm sparkling wine) and better catering in the form of a fresh sandwich.   Avoid!!     has a great alliance network, but it is poorly executed. On the 25th of December I flew out of Sydney via Beijing and Vienna on their pusher network with Air China and Austrian Airlines. Air China was a disastrous experience. The staff told me that I had to check in my luggage again in Vienna when my through ticket was issued all the way to Belgrade. After my agent got involved miraculously all was ok. But no explanation was provided to me.   Then in Belgrade coming home I was lied to and told by that my back via Shanghai could not be Dionne because i had no visa. Upon returning home my agent told me that with an Aussie passport i could be in Shanghai for up to 72 hours ino transit and not have a visa.   The stress that this trip had caused has lead to me being a primary detractor for this company and I will ensure not to speak favourably of them or promote their low fares to friends and family. They have effectively moved to my \"do not fly\" list forever.     After delaying my luggage for 4 days, they have refused to pay damages, even if Montreal Convention and law says they have to.   Their customer service hung up on me multiple times and reduced me to tears more than once, and they still wouldnt refund.     This used to be a good company but they seemed to have lost their way lately. Poor service, delays while the cost of the tickets has gone up every year. Not to mention the introduction of Economy light which is worse than the low cost companies but 3-4 times the price.  I am sorry to say but the only difference between and Ryanair is the price and thats not in their favour.  From 5-6 flights with a year I am now down to 1 at the most. After todays experience it will be 0 next year.     They cancel their flights all the time. We have been waiting more than 20 hours in Frankfurt, and the service is bad.. NEVER USE THEM     If you are reading this & other reviews before thinking of booking a with my advice is DONT. are one of the worst companies Ive ever had dealings with. Their customer service is non existent. They cancelled our from Manchester to Zagreb (via Munich) & told us we would have to fly to Frankfurt the following day but couldnt promise a connecting to Zagreb because all the flights were booked. We reluctantly agreed to travel to Frankfurt the following day & go on the standby list for the Zagreb  When we got back home later Zagreb flights for the following day were openly on sale on Lufthansas website!! They just lie to customers to get rid of them from the check in desks.     Non-existent customer service. Booked a in approximately May to travel in December. I get an email a few months later saying the path has changed (theyve added another stop to the journey), meaning we leave earlier and have a longer layover. I spoke to a customer services rep on the phone who told me send an email. EVERY SINGLE RESPONSE TO MY EMAILS has started with; \"we cant help you...\" its your - if you cant help me who is supposed to? Disgusting behavior & treatment, if I wanted a with multiple stops that is exactly what I would have chosen. Changing the path after bookings have been made (with no compensation) is not acceptable. This will be the last time I fly with  shame as I actually thought they were a decent until now.   Also, if you are a person of colour expect to be borderline strip searched at Frankfurt airport. Pathetic.     After canceled by Lufhansa 5/10/2017 go no reply to my claim, no refund..no nothing. After second reminder still got nothing. They are amazing!     19th Nov Sunday, LH956, Frankfurt to Birmingham Before getting on board, we had to go through a process called document check. Okay no problem. However, after I give the attendant my passport, boading pass and UK BRP cards, I was asked about 6 questions, including Where were I that day, where did I come from, what was I doing in UK, What course I was studying. Neither of these questions happened to others. As a Chinese student studying in UK, this is the first time I was with a company being questioned like that. It was a reaaaaaally bad experience.     Never complained about an before but am very happy to add to the bad reviews on here. The sad thing is that having complained directly to them they really dont care and its a shame that such a big iconic company make you feel your wasting your time even writing a complaint. So much for So Called German Efficiency lol. Even before our trip began I had EIGHT emails informing me of seat changes. I had paid for and selected specific seats and with 4 flights in all we never got any of the original seats I selected. Even on the final home to Manchester when as we boarded the plane in Frankfurt and thought at last we are getting the seats we booked we presented our boarding cards at the podium and it printed out a change of seats ticket AARRGGHHHH!!! When we landed in Frankfurt from Athens we taxied out to a remote stand and got bused around the Terminal, it took TWENTY MINUTES! before we eventually arrived at the Terminal. Police Border control checked everyone and we then had to run to get our connection as the gate they landed us at and the gate we departed from were as far apart as they could be and we only had a hour. We arrived at the gate just as the last passengers were boarding. You could have arranged a Golf Cart style buggy to help us get there but as I said before and is evident from a company that doesnt even bother to reply to the comments on Trustpilot THEY DONT CARE. I can only hope people read this before booking with them as I would never thought I would need to and that I would see such poor reviews for such an iconic brand and Ive only given a couple of the many problems we had with them. AVOID     Ive never complained about an before, but the attendant I had on my from LAX to Frankfurt was a complete jerk.  His name tag read P.uys.  Extremely abrasive and constantly skipped me on beverage services.     purchase the ticket with them cancelled back in August and did not receive refund after three months. Called in and emailed over 10 times, I just got the info, my case is OPEN? Excuse me, we discussed the cancellation 3 months and told me nothing has been proceed? Basically, this is the company ignore your questions and waste customers time.     cancelled my but are not refunding me. I booked 3 tickets CPH-TPA on september 28th with departure in march 2018. One hour later - one hour! - LH cancelled my booking, with an explanation that one leg was not \"confirmed\". Off course I expected LH to refund me, due too LHs own terms and EU rights. This was also confirmed to me twice by the service agent, when he couldnt find an satisfying alternative  Now 6 weeks after LH is still holding my money. Talking to customer service today makes no sense. They hardly speak english, they dont review the case and claims that I have booked non-refundable tickets, but they miss the point: I didnt cancel the  did!     The customer service is horrible, awful attitude and overall bad service! I will never fly again if i can avoid it!!     The worst!  Unknown to me an agent cancelled my reservations and charged the cancellations fees to my credit card!  rebooked the and charged me for another booking over $7,000.  They said they would refund all cost related to the original booking and any change fees that applied ONLY after I paid the $7,000 for the new booking.  I agreed.  Guess what?  They have not returned the $4800 plus for the original booking OR the $600 plus in cancellations fees.  I have waited 2 hours on hold for customer service and every agent gives you a different service.  This has been going on for weeks.  I will never fly again.  Never!      essentially double-charged me (very misleading promo they had) for a set of tickets. I requested a refund (after being bounced between numerous customer relations people) and they agreed to refund the money Id been charged.  They didnt follow through on their promise.  I called their customer relations department, wrote e-mails to their customer relations e-mail addresses (as they requested that I do) explaining my issue. They assured me that they would refund my money. Finally, after about 40 days (and follow-up from me) they refunded a portion of what they agreed to refund. I followed up again in writing and by phone to make sure that they complete the refund. Finally they agreed to refund the remainder but told me to wait another 3-4 weeks.   They again neglected to follow-through.  Now over 80 days have passed since they originally told me theyd refund the money they double-charged me. Although theyve promised verbally and in writing, these promises so far have just been lies because they dont follow through and they actively conceal any sort of escalation process.  Lufthansas customer service may be the worst Ive ever experienced. Dont fly with them.     Worst company ever  never book with them     Worst customer service ever ! I booked an international trip for my mother through United, for a operated by  Huge mistake ! They profiled my mother to not be able to do her check in online, but at the airport. And so she could not choose her seat prior to her arrival to the airport and of course she got a middle seat instead of the aisle seat that she wanted. I even tried to upgrade her seat and I was told that this will not be possible either. Bad and rude customer service. I will not use in the future. There are other options to choose from.     The customer service sucks. They hang up on you when they dont feel like answering your question. RUDE. No more explanation needed. If you can still choose another  definitly do so. As if I wanted to call. Their website sucks so much that you have to call their ridiculous expensive 0900 number and after that you still got nothing.     I have been travelled for work at least 20 times a year every year for the last 3 years and I must take because from Frankfurth airport they take all the usefull times of the day. After all this time I have enough statistic to say that sucks!!!! They are ALWAYS in late and there never was one time I arrived on the scheduled time at the ariport of arrival. If it is a lucky I arrive with ONLY 30 mins of delay, otherwise you can wait for hours. The service they offer on board is nothing better than other companies, the prieces are high and the delay is much worse than every other company I travelled with.     I could not agree more with the sentiments expressed about this company. My was cancelled twice (due to bad weather). But apart from the 11-hour queue to get accommodation, I have no problems with the fact that my flights were cancelled. However what I do have a problem with is the shocking response from their customer service. I have emailed them, spoke to them, on numerous occasions over the past 8 weeks. But to no avail. Firstly, after 3 weeks of discussion, they agree to pay my expenses and then say that because it was a code share, they are not liable (TAP Portugal - who still have not responded), I need a receipt for my rescheduled flights. Sounds simple. But oh no, this is  Again, no response. How many times does it take to tell them that the receipt function on their website is not working!!! It will be a long time before I travel with this again.     Where to start... this is my first (and will certainly be my last) time flying with you. End to end rude and incompetent staff. Outbound cancelled. Put up in a hotel and the transport to take us back the next day wasnt running. No information at all. Had to wait an hour for bag drop. delayed on return leg and the staff have the cheek to call it a \"replanned departure\". Its called a delay. This just added insult to injury. As a very business and personal frequent flyer I can safely say this is the worst Ive ever come across. At least you know where you stand with Ryanair etc.     lost our luggage during a transfer via Munich Airport. It has been 35 days now. I claimed lost luggage under Montreal convention after 21 days and they refuse to acknowledge it saying I should wait another 100 days. I filed them to small claims courts Söp Germany and ARN Sweden.     Dear Sir or Madam,  I and my husband use service of for last 25 years. But 22.06.2017 I had bad experience of using this company. They cancelled my Nr. LH893 from Riga to Frankfurt, so my son and I lost our from Frankfurt to Miami.  The company offered us to fly 3 different airlines with 3 transfers. Each transfer to another I supposed to carry on the 32 kg luggage by myself. Usually only international direct flights accept 32 kg luggage. So I would have to buy other suitcases to sort my luggage. After that my son and I would have to bring all suitcases by our hands to the next gate. So it was absolutely impossible to accept this offer.  I have to note that it was problems with communication with airport representatives in Riga cause doesnt has  its own representation in Riga, so stuff suppose to call to company by every question to solve the problem.  As your company cancelled our my son had lost his to Boston so he didnt get to the sport camp. I had so many problems and expenses due to this situation. We wrote letters, called for many times, but we did not get any concrete answer.  This attention to regular clients from worldwide famous airlines company looks weird.  I just want to know how to solve this situation.     My 7 year old son is now stranded in Vancouver with his 14 year old sister because would not allow them to board their  Lufthansas policy us to allow this but unbeknownsted to us the was operated under Air Canada which requires the younger Child to be at least 8. Both Children now stranded for 24 Hours and having to pay over $2000 for new flights not mentioning the hotel fee incurred. Very disappointed with Lufthansas lack of empathy for my now stranded children.     I found my experience with inacceptable. I asked for a wheel chair for my latest trip overseas to Miami and the service was beyond bad . We were treated ( the passengers that asked for a wheel chair ) very badly , taking us from bus to bus , from terminal to terminal and no whelk chair was provided . When asked they said a bus is like a wheel chair and the internal airport trolley is like a wheel chair ... really . Never heard this in my life . So we had to walk up and down with no help , I have a knee injury and was in pain but no one cared about it . We were treated Like cheeps and the employee of were very rude .  Even the hostesses in the plane were the same . After ringing 5 times the red button and no answer, I had to get up myself and get water .  Very bad experience. Will not fly anymore .     APPALLING SERVICE FROM  On 16 July 2017 LH953 was late, hence I only managed to get out of the plane at Frankfurt at 11.45, rather than 11.25. I asked the attendants to call so that they could send somebody to take me straight to the gate to catch my connection LH 1338 to Budapest, but they told me to simply get there as soon as possible.  Please note: HAD SENT representatives to meet people who had a connecting to Rome and one other destination. They were waiting for them outside the plane.  I run to the relevant gate as fast as I could. I went through passport control very quickly by using the automated gates and I was allowed to do security without having to wait. No-one could have reached the gate to catch my connection any faster.  I arrived at the gate to get my connection at 12.10, five minutes before departure time. The gate was closed and I was denied boarding. I was given a boarding pass for the following  LH 1340, and arrived in Budapest at 18.00 - 4hours and 15 min later than originally planned. This caused several problems, as this was a business trip.  I told by a attendant on the back that they never wait for one or two people&#8230; Just too few. Three and a half weeks later I am still waiting for to even acknowledge my complaint in writing, let alone resolve it. I will never fly with them again. Avoid.     unforgettable trip thanks to  Let me tell you about my last trip with   Im a student and In April I went on vacation with my friend to India &#127470;&#127475; after we saved some money for this trip.  we bought tickets from a website to go and back with Brussels airlines which cost us 750€ (for now I can say that they have collaboration). We got the tickets to the mail and everything was great! In the way back we arrived to Mumbai airport 3 hours before the  when we approach to the desk of Brussels Airlines we find out that our tickets cancelled somehow. We were shock !   In Brussels counter they said that its very weird but they cant help us..   We even ask the women in charge to give us a call for the Brussels office and she refused. Even a family on the line tried to help to convince the woman to call Brussels and help us and she Refused. I have to say that she was very unpleasant and servile! After that we succeed call to Brussels office from the airport information and they didnt know what to say. After hours of conversations with every person or company that passed in our minds, we understood that we stuck In Mumbai airport! with no help from no body, very exhausted and tearful from this long day we understand that we have to buy new tickets... But in Brussels the was full, so we asked several flights company (one of them was  and all the flights was overbooked or already left.  Somehow after hours we find tickets on Ethiopian airlines with 15 hours connection in Addis Ababa... its just was one more thing for this day. The new tickets cost for each one of us 42,534 INR ( something like 660$).  After all that and very long 15 hours in Ethiopia I lost a work day and back home with very bitter taste for the end of the trip.  Back home with help from the website company we turned to and thats what we found: a glitch on the airlines system prevented from the agent seeing on time the schedule change.  What means that I paid 660$ for a new tickets because of glitch! After all its makes sense...  What more absurd than that (yes there is more..) its that didnt takes the responsibility! \"For saying that they offered on the spot a free of charge alternative option with Brussels Airways, but you rejected it and purchased new tickets\". And of course it completely lie!   I have to say that I thought I buy a ticket from a company that respect herself, but unfortunately I figured that Im was wrong.   Its seems like a power game and not a fair game! If being honest its seems like they know that no costumer will sue, cause they have more resources (and unfortunately they are right).     The international was good But the between Munich and Berlin was a disaster!  I thought that the airplane is falling and this is the end of my life!!!! I Was really shocked!  I was not expecting sush a poor and old airplane!! Also well trained staff.     First almost one hour delayed due to overbooking. Missed connecting  Ended up being 3.5 hours late. Bad customer service on top.  Unacceptable. Never again.     Ive been dealing with quite a few Airlines - and only chose to fly with because of their really cheap return to New Zealand.  Their Customer Service so far is shocking !! No manners on the phone at all - the Call center sounds like its located in India or Filipines.  I regret booking with them and should have gone with a more expensive      Real bad customer service. The consultant is very impolite and impatient.     Good service is a rare thing in the travel industries. However stands out from the crowd by far. I have flown on a weekly basis and I have experienced attendants not only to be friendly, but also quick on their feet to cope with any issues and one time even turning into stand up comedians.  When I had a problem with their Star Alliance partner United, immediately reimbursed me for damages that had occurred, even though it was Uniteds fault and not Lufthansas fault.     Had a canceled from Frankfurt to CDG but arranged another planned 4 hours later. That was delayed and we arrived in CDG where we found out our baggages were delayed or lost... There was only one person in the airport that helped with the report form but when we wanted to leave the place, almost all the exit doors were closed and it took a long time to figure out which one was opened. It was so late there was no taxi, no bus or shuttle. The place started to be dangerous with a few weirdos coming there at night. We managed to sign up on Uber and get a taxi... did not give a damn about us and their staff actually look down at all their desperate customers looking for help. First time but definitely last time with      Overall ok service but even though i had booked baby bassinet i didnt get it. I had to carry my 1 1/2 years baby on my arms for almost 9 hours. That being not all, one of the workers almost CRUSHED my babies head with their table like thing which what they serve food in. I can understand that she couldnt maybe see us from the other side but it doesn hurt to be carefull espesially if there are kids on bord. I get shocked and heavy hearted whenever i think about it and suppose i didnt reacted on time to move my babies slepping head away &#128544;&#128549;     Hi. My girlfriend had booked a return from Edinburgh to Bologna. Unfortunately a serious issue had caused her to missed the first to Italy. She managed to book another and away she went. On her way back, upon arriving to the airport, she discovered that her return had been cancelled! Obviously she never got a refund on that  despite the fact that she paid for it and she intended to use it. Customer service told her that they can do what they want. basically she tried to book the same but the second leg of the journey was sold out. They took her seat, kept her money and sold it to somebody else. Well done!     7 August 2016 I filled a complaint/request on the website. I got a polite answer back that they would answer asap. In October 2016 I asked for a status and feed-back and received the same auto generated message. Today is the 17 April 2017 and I have heard absolutely nothing. Thank you for flying      I have booked a connecting fligt through Expedia, and have missed the second leg, because the layover was apparently too short. The staff at the service desk was very unfriendly and uprofessional. First they told me that I need to find my own way how to resolve this. After talking to the manager, they agreed to issue a new ticket for the next day, but refused to pay for the hotel. I also got a lesson from customer service manager, that I should book flights with longer layovers in the future.Apparently I was too naive to think that booking a connecting was good enough...     got me there but inflight service was poor.  food was sub standard     I had just walked out of the plane and realized I had left two iPads in the back of the seat in front of me. I asked to go back and retrieve them and they would not let me. First they told me they would be retrieved and left in the lost and found within 3 hours. Then they said they would email me within 3 to 5 business days letting me know if they had them. They ended up turning in the one iPad but not the other which doesnt make sense since they were together. When I tried to locate the lost and found employees were extremely rude and they didnt seem to know the process of getting my items from lost and found or exactly where lost and found was. If its possible use a different      Try to get my sons airport tax back, but as I went with edream travel agency, they refuse to give the refund. Ive tried to liaise between them but no use.  Both accuse of each other. say they called me to settle this matter, but I had never received that call. I am so angry. Dont use this company.     We were flying from Miami to Frankfurt.  We booked our tickets months before.  When checking in at the Airport,  we were told that unfortunately we were not seated together..  Four rows with 11 and 13 rows between each stats.  My 8 and 12 year old boys were sad and scared. We Are from Danmark,  so they speak very little English and no German. At the way to USA the 8 year old was flightsick and was trowing up, who should manage this?  The French lady next to him????  At the checkin desk and at the gate we met no understanding. At the we met a nice flightattendand,  who helped us and other families with same problem. She arranged so we sat two and two..   Why does this problem accure?  It is not nice for your personel,  who have the challenges at the   to find the solutions.  You can see it is a family with children travelling together before seating the flights.   Who should explain and translate the safety onboard procedures for the children,  when they are left by themselves by  It was the same problem for another family,  when we were travelling with our next from Frankfurt to Copenhagen.   They were split up and one of the children weekend crying,  so the were calling the father at the speaker.    Luckely we were with SAS at the way to USA.    Sanne / Denmark     Had to change in Frankfurt, 1 hour delayed, evreything was caos, no information was given on the plane, they sent us running to catch our connecion, eventhoug they had already re-booked us for the next day. When asked they me misleading information rather than tell the truth.     I am one of Lufthansas frequent flyers programme premium members, yet, despite numerous complaints - including to the CEO - nothing has changed, but I have received a ton of excuses and explanations. On a from Malaga to Bucharest via Munich, the food served in Business class was a disgrace. Three olives and some tired salad leaves, half an egg and some pumpkin seeds. When I think of the nearly 700 euros that the ticket cost, I wonder what kind of service they include to justify such a shameless meal service. And yet nobody ever solves this issue which occurs on more and more of their flights. It seems like they are making cost saving, but on whose expense? The tickets keep getting more expensive, while the service can now compete neck to neck with low cost airlines, which you can fly at a fraction of the cost. Its plain simple, unless there is no other travel alternative, I will stop flying this and when I have to fly with them, I will make sure I bring food from home with me.     I had the worst nightmare last night here in HK airport after the people ransact my bag look what is inside and even scroll my private messages with my boyfriend in skype, told me to show my money, check my palm if it is soft or hard and interrogate me with questions only a Consul in an embassy asks. They underestimate the Switzerland Consul in Taipei for giving me visa because they say i have no money enough for the travel and i have no credit card. (Anyway, my schengen visa is a sponsored visa by my boyfriend in Switzerland and we proved it to the embassy that we are capable of the vacation cost). Luthansa dont want me to use their to fly to Munich then to Zurich because they say i dont have money. My round trip ticket is booked by a travel agent in Malters, she see to it that schedule is the fastest i can get that time that is why we choose that after i miss my last night via Air France (HK-CDG), i book that ticket online which the destination is TPE-HK-CDG-ZRH and back. I came from Taipei via Cathay Pacific and only 1 hr stop duration in HK. I was not able to disembark from the plane and have hard time finding the Air France transfer desk, when i locate it its already close. So i waited the next night in the airport and this time my boyfriend got me a ticket from which do the disaster to me last night. This german guy from let me feel how small i am because i am a Filipino and my president is Duterte, which is beyond their role and i dont understand what are they doing to me anymore. I lost all my energy and just cried and cried at the airport after i was not able to fly, they left me with a word that \"if you insist to use we will send you back to Taipei\"! This company maybe good but the people they employed especially in HK are monsters. They brought trauma to my life...i cant stop my tears falling everytime i remember what they do to me last night. I hope this will not happen to anyone too especially to fellow Filipinos and most especially those that have partners from Europe like me. They judge me because my boyfriend is 49 yrs old and i am 34. They even ask me how we meet, if i do love him and he to me, if we are planning to get married soon and if my boyfriend gives me money and how much is it. The worst people in the world are employed by and they are in HK airport.     We were scheduled to fly from Frankfurt to London on a departing at 11am. We were told there would be a slight delay in departure due to fog at London Heathrow. We boarded the plane ready for a 1:30pm departure, doors closed, jetway withdrawn, ready to go.  Nothing!  We just sat on the plane for several hours at the gate. The pilot then announced that the reason for the delay was that despatch failed to file an updated plan and therefore we lost our departure slot.  We were deplaned and told to wait at the gate as they were going to file the plan and be allocated another departure slot. We were told though that we would now be at the bottom of the list. Eventually we departed at close to 6:30pm. When contacting customer service for compensation under EU regulations they said it was weather related and no compensation was due. I said if that was the case why did the scheduled to depart for London after us leave 3 hours BEFORE us.  They just replied \"case is closed, no further comment will be made\". Bad, bad customer service topped with the fact that all we were offered during the delay was a cup of water and a KItKat chocolate bar.  Never will I be flying with again. They clearly dont care. \"Non-stop you\" is their slogan. More like \"we will stop you\".     We booked our for a ski trip back in august. We wanted to go in january. To be sure we could bring our own skis we called customer service. They assured us that there would be room for our equipment. A week later we called again to make sure that there would be room for it. Getting close to the vacation we once again called in mid january. This time they told us they didnt have room and nobody made a note of it in the system. Even though we called three times to make sure, we are now in Austria with no way of bringing our equipment with us home. We tried calling customer service, but all they could do for us was to offer a reebooking that we have to pay for ourselves. The price of the reebooking is more than the price of the origanal ticket. On top of that the customer service staff was rude and non compliant in any way. Really bad customer service from and a ridiculous situation to put customers in!     On our trip from Miami to Billund in January 2017 we experienced two out of three delayed flights. We almost missed one of the arrivals because of delays from Munich. We were told that they were unable to find two seats together on the hole trip, eventhough there were lots of empty seats... Just not OK!  On the from Miami to Munich there were not food enough so we all could have the oppotunity to choose our meal ourselves... Just nok OK either!  When we arrived to DK we were delayed again and our bagage were missing.     Disgrace of Service!! Already 15 days passed since I sent an email (including 5 reminders and 2 telephone calls) and still waiting a reply! This after my was delayed and my luggage did not arrive in Innsbruck. Will never use your service again and definitely NOT RECOMMENDABLE! Feedback ID 30792658     I was supposed to travel from Lyon to San Francisco via Frankfurt and Calgary BUT...  The first from Lyon to Frankfurt arrived late so I missed the connection to Calgary.  I went to Lufthanse Customer Service desk, waited more than 1.5h and I got rerouted to San Francisco via Tel Aviv.  Finally I arrived 8.5h late in SFO. The point is that they lost my baggage... Apparently they forgot to rerout my baggage with me. So it is probably in Frankfurt but actually I dont know. It has been now 3 days and I am in San Francisco without clothes and without the medication I need to take everyday... The baggage claim service is not answering my calls, I only have an automatic email every 6 hours telling me that they dont know where my baggage is...     Not only did they cancel my husbands and delay his trip by 24 hours in Houston, but they tried to avoid paying us compensation, quoting some crap about EU legislation, when their website clearly states they are liable. Once I questioned that, I was suddenly entitled to compensation!  Wonder how many other customers they have ripped off by quoting the same excuse? Now they have lost my luggage from the UK to NZ (I paid extra for this bag), and 10 days later it still hasnt arrived. No-one is interested, no one helps you, their Face Book page is a sad excuse for service, as they are purely a \"social media\" team, who have no access to anything. Look at their page to see all the complaints they get. Cannot begin to describe how furious I am with this company - cant believe they are still in business.     Was told in June Id receive a full refund for my ticket due to a visa denial. We are now January and still havent received it. Why? First they sent it to to the wrong person. Then after months of fighting with them, they admitted that and told me theyd reissue the refund. That was in early November. We are now January and even though I was told in November Id have my refund in 3 to 4 weeks, I still dont and no one ever responds to your emails or contacts you when they say they will. I will never buy another ticket from  Just not worth it!!!     We checekd in 3 1/2\" hours before our  through no fault of our own we were 10 minutes before our exiting security at beijing airport. We were greeted by a female ground staff member who promtly announced we had missed our and that our luggage was now back in the main terminal. We were given the following options 1: Remain in China or 2: Pay £1307 each to fly back to the UK. Thats £2614.00 for my wife and I to return home, cost of the original \"return\" flights was £1300.00 for both of us.  No other assistance was given by the staff apart from a scrap of paper with the ticket office number  On our return I raised a \"feedback request\" in essence a way of not saying a complaint. It took them over a week to respond with a feedback ref number, 2 months later they refused any responsibility, said that our case had been fully investigated and said they would not be offering any refund. We are now 3 months since first email and are still unable to get a response from  they say they now need to contact Beijing airport for full details, their initial full investigation had not including speaking to anyone where the incident occured. I have had to re-write this as complained about my initial review on some minor technicalities. But if your thinking of flying with them I suggest you have a re-think, perhaps visit their facebook page and read a few days worth of visitor posts. It contains a huge amount of complaints. The choice is yours     Never travel by from pune...Extremely bad experience.My parents missed their connecting from frankfurt due to some scheduled fuel stop which delayed their ..They had to stay in the line for more than 2 hours for rebooking ...no wheelchair service on time...They did not even gave them hotel room to rest...Its more than 55 hours they have been traveling and their from frankfurt was delayed again by 50 minutes.I am hoping they will be able to get on connecting from newark to seattle and reach home safely....Tey are 60 + age....I want them to reimburse our money...     used to be good, but have hit rock bottom now, awful and disgusting customer service. Rude arrogant staff. Delayed our vacation by 6 whole days, made us pay $2500 in extra fees and my little boy got an asthma attack because of them! They dont treat people like humans. We got ZERO help from them during all this ordeal. There are so many dissatisfied customers, just go to their facebook page and scroll down. However they delete a lot of the negative feedback!     No shame at in Frankfurt. 2 deaf passengers are left to freeze like homeless people, just because made a mistake and allowed them to board a  without checking the visa issue properly. What happened to the carrier responsibility?  What happened to IATA laws? What happened to international aviation rules? Not with  they are big enough to just spit on deaf passengers and when I try to assist from far away, they just slam the phone on me! If you are a passenger with special needs, please do not fly  Well, try not to fly at all! Only one word in this case: SHAME     Stuck in kiev, ukraine because our was cancelled due to strike. If that wasnt enough the link they sent for us to rebook does not work. All contact numbers are unanswered, no email, no offices that can help. They apologize for our unconvenience and keep referring to links that are out of service, down or no longer exist.  Worst experience ever. No respect for your customers and will demand a refund as soon as you finally return to earth and answer your phones.     I am writing to express my sincere disappointment with Lufthansas customer service, or lack there of.  Our expanding international media business has found us making a significant amount of overseas travel.  We have tried in the past and were overall pleased.  Due to those experiences, we decided to use as our primary carrier in Europe. Unfortunately, our future use of will be terminated after the latest debacle with our return    While on our most recent trip, we were required to fly from Munich to Dusseldorf, to Frankfurt, then to Los Angeles California from Frankfurt.  Our from Munich to Dusseldorf Flt# LH2002 was delayed by an hour and by the time we exited the aircraft in Dusseldorf the next should have already left.  We rushed to the gate anyway only to find the next Flt# LH0075 was delayed as well.  We waited nearly an hour past scheduled time for the to take off.  Upon landing in Frankfurt we were nearly 40 minutes past \"boarding time\" for Flt# LH0456 to LA.  During taxi, the attendant made an announcement saying that they had checked and that \"all the connecting flights were still at their gates and that they would be held for us\".  We quickly exited the plane in terminal A and had to make it to terminal Z which was over a mile of walking.  We ran the entire way and upon arrival at the Los Angeles gate (Z58) the plane was still there.  The gate attendants informed us that we had missed the (even though it was still sitting there).  The directed us to customer service.    We arrived at customer service to figure out what is next.  They offered us a on United airlines in economy coach.  This would not work because my husband is 67 tall and simply cant physically fit into the tiny spaces provided in coach.  This is the very reason that we booked premium economy with in the first place. Two different representatives told us there were no other flights back available with Premium Economy as we had booked originally. Therefore they rerouted us back to Munich and said the only other available with Premium Economy was the next day (Nov. 15th) at 12pm out of Munich.  We were told the reason for the delays in our connecting flights on November 14th, was \"due to weather.\" We were in disbelief of this, however, because it was blue skies and 50F at all our destinations. So being part of the media ourselves, we decided to do a bit of research. Come to find out  starting November 8th, has had a rash of strikes. We are aware that there was a significant amount of action surrounding these strikes on the 14th and 15th. We as customers should not be held accountable for strikes happening within Lufthansas organization.  We also realize that our complaint directly relates to the EU Regulation 261/2004/EC, and that we are entitled to some form of compensation after being rerouted back to our original destination (Munich) and being flown out the next day extending our arrival at LAX to well over 24 hours delay.  In continuation, we left the following day Nov 15th, 2016 on Flt# LH0452. Once again, this was delayed for an hour.  When we landed in Los Angeles we realized that one of our bags was missing &#8211; Bag Tag LH227450.  This case contained a very expensive film camera.  The representatives were unable to locate it at all and after a half hour, we were sent on our way with no resolution.  The following day we needed that case and camera to conduct business with in Los Angeles.  We were thereby, camera less, and useless &#8211; and lost a day of work.     That brings us to today.  While we were hopeful that would be a great new for our international business, much of that hope has quickly dissipated.  The one-day (28 hour) delay was very costly to us and our business.  We had to miss out on scheduled film interviews with clients.  We then spent a significant part of the day calling clients, cancelling appointments, writing letters to airlines, and following up on where our camera may be.  In total we lost $1,200.00 in wages, spent $100 on transportation home and wasted the rest of our day cleaning up after Lufthansas mess.  Today (November 18th,2016) I have spent more than 3 hours trying to rectify this situation through Lufthansas \"customer service\" department to no avail. Forewarning, they will NOT compensate you even if your claim falls under EU Reg. 216. For icing on the cake, after filing my complaint, my Yahoo account was inundated with over 250 duplicate emails from their customer service center over the span of 4 hours. Bravo  I would, nor will I, EVER refer this to consumers.     long waiting times to speak to operator and took so long to just correct a spelling mistake in ticket that too they charged $ 225     I lost my baggage when travelling to USA due to a tight transfer in Frankfurt. I immediately contacted in the airport to report it missing (ORDLH64977). said they would forward it a.s.a.p. however I was there for 2 nights and never received it. Since then I have mailed every week including Customer Service and Baggage Tracing however until now without success. Rrating of 2 stars because mostly it is a good service from the company. This time I am quite chocked of the ineffectiveness.     I booked a ticket through sembo / dtf-travel to Beijing from Stockholm in spring 2013. Deparure july 2013 and return january 2014 and flew first to copenhagen and then beijing. I get a warning that i need to pay within the next hour or my booking will no longer be avaliable. Suddenly my return ticket had changed to austrian airlines and a stop in vienna instead of copenhagen. I tried in every way to change the ticket but both sembo and austrian airlines refused even though there were 9 months until the  I was not even allowed to talk to austrian airlines. I accept my situation and make then aware that ive booked a return ticket from vienna with german wing instead on the the return day, because i need to go to copenhagen. A month before my return home over vienna they cancel the and force me to go with over frankfurt. I tell them i have a plane ticket home from vienna, but they dont care and in a treatening manner tell me to take the airplane over frankfurt or lose the ticket! They wont change the which i told them was made in some kind of mistake 9 months before, but then cancel on me 1 month before so i cant catch my comprimised in vienna. The worst part is that i couldnt catch my german wings  because they forced me to go on a  German wings and are the same damn company!     I bought a return from New Zealand to the UK with  and broke the journey for a few days in San Francisco. Due to my own poor planning I arrived at the check in desk at San Francisco 45 minutes before the and was denied boarding (their cut off is 60 minutes) which wasnt great but is fair enough. They stated that the rest of my return was unaffected, and that I only had to pay for a new from San Francisco to London. Annoying, but not insane.   However, 2 days before my return from the UK to New Zealand, I contacted then to confirm everything was OK and they said I now had to pay a £4466 reissuing fee, 3 times the original price of the ticket and over 5 times the cost of buying the same with a different with 3 days notice, which is what I chose to do instead in the end.   This is a short summary of a very stressful time with innumerable call centre staff members, all of which seemed perfectly polite and continuously gave me conflicting information as to whether I had a valid ticket or not, and every single one of the interactions generated no paper trail or email correspondence.  They just left me horribly in the lurch in a completely unreasonable way and I recommend other pe0ple avoid this      The pilot was either drunk, or it was his first time flying an aircraft. It was a really bad experience. No turbulence, just an unsteady pilot. Horrible.   Aside from that, failed at these points: 1. Overbooked  one passenger was asked to take the next   2. Crew members showed no manners, and refused to help us move around peoples jackets and small bags in the overhead compartments, to make room for our luggage. They told us it was \"full\" and that we had to keep our luggage by our feet.  3. Frankfurt airport was bad. You had to climb up and down stairs, and take a bus to the runway while standing and holding your luggage. I have bad balance and I almost fell over in the stairs and on the bus.     Although I havent had reason to fly with for some years now, I still remember the good service that they were known for.  Last October, I had serious problems with Austrian and one of their agents in Vienna, as I changed flights to return to London from Sofia, even recommended that I fly with \"Easyjet\" lol  The 2nd leg of my was as bad as the 1st.  The so called meal, which then became a snack, which then became a fun size chocolate bar was less than the small cake that I got between Sofia and Vienna.  I complained to Austrians Head Office and was refused any compensation for the more serious problems of having to pay for luggage at check in when it was included in the ticket that I had been overcharged for, amongst other issues.  So, I cut my losses and forgot about it.  just over six months later and I received an email from (who now own Austrian Airlines) Customer Services and they offered me £223 compensation.  What a surprise that was!  Anyway, it appears that when took over Austrian, they identified a number of problems with Austrians Customer Service and that their actions, including lack of, were damaging and therefore decided to review Austrians complaints.  My complaint eventually came up and although Austrian had decided not to compensate, decided that I should have been compensated.  That is what I remember about  reliable  good inflight service and good customer service.  could have just ignored my original complaint and I would not have been bothered as the shole experience was long forgotten.     Im sorry to say it. But the worst costumer service i ever experience!  I went to Tegel airport in Berlin yesterday from Munich with out my baggage. I talk with the service in the airport. I said they had made a mistake, and his solution to was that i will have my baggage today. I told him that i had some bad experience on my journey with  A cancel and four out of four delayed flights. I told him that i could wait for another 4 hours so i could get my baggage, but they had to pay for my bus tickets, that the one i paid for not will be refund, it will have cost you 20 euros from Berlin to Flensburg. But nu he insisted and said that i should take the bus on time. I have a vacation in Malaga tomorrow as i told him WITH OUT ANY CLOTHES! My insurances will not pay my to get some new clothes because, its on my way home. I called you this morning and you still promise me, that i will have it today. 17 oclock i got a text massage it said that it will be delivered tomorrow. Excellent. Its to late! Im so dissapointed! Your costumer sucks! I will never choice again! Terrible!     Our name on the tickets was stated incorrectly (part of the last name was missing); it took three weeks to state that this would *probably* cause no issues. Of course, *probably* is not good enough for a with four people family from The Netherlands to Japan, and were still not sure whether were good or not.  If that wasnt enough, the ticket could not be added to our website account, neither could it be displayed or modified. Every time the booking number generated an error. We called the IT department, the only department able to solve this problem, and spent 24 minutes trying to explain what was going on. They confirmed the issue and guaranteed the problem would be solved the next day. Now its four weeks later, and Lufthansas webcare simply tells us to go through all loops again: that is calling an IT department that has no mail address, does not pick up the phone or makes empty promises.  Instead of going through all loops again, we have now contacted a lawyer who is handling our case, as explaining that the IT department cannot be reached up to seven times in a row simply results in the same answer from Lufthansas web team: please try again. No one offers to make the call for us, and apparently even cannot e-mail its own IT department.   A lawyer for a simple name change/extra booking. Can you imagine?     came home from a long vacation with a stop over with LH. the was delayed due to a medical emergency with one of the pax on the ground. So we came in late to Frankfurt, too late for our connecting flght. LH already had everything organized: hotel overnight with dinner and breakfast the next morning and a new booking to our destination the next morning. That is service that I like!! 10 points for LH this time again and by the way, the price of the ticket was very competitive!!     cancelled one of my connecting flights without any warning. I found out about the cancellation, two days prior to the  when i went to manage my booking. I called the service center and they were not able to book another for me, so i had to cancel my entire vacation. This has been my first and last time using  Do NOT fly with them.     sucks,  Ieaving Orlando LH0465 No seats. overbooked. Our two kids 11 and 13 years old got a seat different places in the plain away from me and my wife who also where seatet different places. Shame on you kids sitting alone for a 9 hour fligt.  We were a group of 14 people and the tickets bought for over 3 monts. Now you have 14 customers less in the future.     Very poor service has changed my to Havana several times before I came away. So they send me a cancellation and rebooking, which can not be done, then I will land in Frankfurt, later than my to Denmark leave. So I call  and I sit on hold for 35 min, and the lady says its hard, and to have to call back tomorrow. It takes three days, and I hear nothing. So I call again, and being put on hold for an hour and 15 minutes. and then I was disconected. I call again, waiting to get through for 20 minutes, and when I come through, I ask to get my money back for the tickets that I bought a long time ago. Now I stand without a ticket, and must buy with another company, and it costs $ 500 more. Never again     Last week I realised that hat changed our trip home from Thailand. They gave us 25 min to transfer in Singapore. Called service but  could NOT get help...they would hardly talk to me. Really rude !!!! We could NOT get a new ticket same Day ... I Can see that they do fly from Koh on the 30 marts.  Really bad. Shame on &#128550;     We bought tickets on their website 4 months ago. At the airport we had a problem with your passport (because of the 3 months rue) and they told us that they cant help us because we bought the lowest class price. However they told us to contact their Customer Service by phone. We asked about our back that should be in 12 days and we were told \"because we didnt catch your first the return was canceled\". After calling the Customer Service and talking about 3 hours, they told us that they will help us. After all that, they \"found\" a solution for us and that was a new ticket with all costs. They did not help us they only find a new ticket, the same what we could do by our self. This was the worst experience that I had with any airlines!!! I will avoid this horrible  airlines.     They left us stranded in Venice airport, as we had not used the outbound ticket from Copenhagen.  The outbound ticket could not be used as they were on a strike, we could get no help from to rebook, so we had to buy new tickets with EasyJet.  We were then forced to buy our own tickets again to get home from Venice. This time a much higher price, because it was in last minute. There were no help from the ticket office, just \"you have to pay your own ticket again, if you want to get home\".   Now I can see on Facebook that they are announcing another strike. DO NOT BUY TICKETS WITH  you will not get any help when the next strike are coming.  STAY AWAY.     Cancelled  no prior notice of Strike!  Had to wait in airport for 7 hours - shocking customer service on the phone with no offer of any compensation     I fly fairly regularly but this was my first time with  I was going on a weekend away that required one change on to another plane.  Everything was going to according to plan, we arrived early at the airport, we got on the plane on time but then the plane didnt move.  Apparently they had lost someones luggage, so they made us sit on a plane for 50 minutes without it moving at all.   We were starting to worry about our next at this point, but they assured us that we would be able to catch it in time.  The plane arrived later than intended, we ran across the airport but the gate had been closed for 20 minutes.    There was no one there to ask.  We went to go find the help desk, furious that they just made us miss our connecting  they gave us a ticket, we had to wait nearly an hour until they called our ticket number so that we could tell them we had missed our because of them.   They booked us on a new with Baltic Air which turned out to be a very good company but at the cost of 6 hours of waiting at the airport and a good chunk of our weekend away eaten in to.  We were offered at the time no explanation, no assistance, no apology, we were passed from person to person within the company.  We were left furious.  After reading up on this company online and speaking with people at the airport who had also had bad experiences with them, the only reason Im giving two star is because they at least booked us on an that knows how to do things properly.  Funnily enough, when we had arrived back in the UK and were on the train home, we overheard another person on the train who was angry because he had missed a train that he had booked due to being late.     / UA cansellered our tickets on the return from Honolulu Hawaii to San Fransisco USA. had not given us any compensation on we could not return to San Fransisco and we missed 2 days in Hilton Hotel San Fransisco which we had paid for in advance. We have tried to contact CEO Carsten Spohr in without any positiv reply. We have NOT received any compensation from !  THIS IS A VERY BAD SERVICE  We cannot reccomend and UA to future trips. Bjarne Thenning Denmark     We flew from Saudi to Heathrow in July and had confirmation of changed return flights from the booking agency and  I even confirmed and received e-tickets early the morning we were due to fly back from Heathrow on July 21st.  However, at check-in there were no seats for us, apparently we had missed our    The booking agents didnt complete the change of date, but we werent informed by the agency or  to the contrary, both confirmed the new date. Had to pay another 1,905 pounds to get home the next day.  Their error in confirming our cost me 2,500 pounds for new flights and the hotel overnight at Heathrow. Terrible confusion and stress for us and our two young girls.  I DONT UNDERSTAND WHY WE WERE NOT INFORMED THERE WAS A PROBLEM WEEKS BEFORE WE FLEW, AND WHY OUR FLIGHTS WERE CONFIRMED, VERBALLY AND VIA E-TICKET THAT MORNING?  Then, they dont care - just a Not Our Problem response, agency error. Even the pleasant rep at Heathrow admitted had made an error - they still took another 2000 pounds from me though. Shocking service - tantamount to CORPORATE THEFT.  Now I am taking agency to court in UK to retrieve the totoal 3,447 that their combined error cost me.     They write, that the seat reservation is possible in a mail to you. It is not, 3 days in a row errors occur. Efficiency? not exactly, simple things like this should work. If you try to get membership, it is oldfashioned and a really bad experience, try flying SAS, VUELING OR NORWEGIAN, they can do the trick for you.     Do not but tickets thru this company. When the tickets are bought, theres nothing to do, if you cant travel for some reasons.  You cant change the names, you cant get any money back -  not even for a loss of money.  You CAN change the date, but with a extra cost of 3xtimes your old ticket.  Worse experience ever!     is not respecting people and they are giving a really poor service. To day I overheard how the ground personal I Frankfurt misinformed a family because needed a set in a overbook  I cant recommend - my  the fligt at the side gate were heavy overbooked - use a another Company when your are traveling. They are not giving any service, and you are not even a number, just a creditcard     I have unfortunately taken several times. but every time I get disappointed of the staffs behavior. My last with  the stewardess woke me up before the plane flew, she claimed that my seat was not adjusted correctly. I got angry, because I didnt touch my seat and she didnt care about waking me up. She wasnt even trying to adjust my seat, as if accepted that it was unadjustable.   The grew think that they can do whatever they wanna do without any regrets. So no more for me. Trust me, Im not going to fly with      are AGENT AND AIRLINES joining hands to trouble customer?? I think so!   I recently had booked a round trip air ticket with #Vayama from Chicago to India. It was an AWFUL experience, and cost me a lot of money and time, that too during the night stranded at airport, away from my hometown.   Copy of ticket attached. Nowhere the ticket mentioned any connection might require any visas. Given my usual self I try to be cautious, after booking my ticket on May 1st, I had called #on May 2nd, to confirm of any travel documents needed. They confirmed that as it is all international connection (Delhi to Vienna to Frankfurt to Chicago) and no change of airport there is no visa required. I had 3 months at that time, from May 2nd to July 24th to get the Schengen visa, had I been given with the right information or at least they could have said we dont know.  - I said I had spoken to customer care and confirmed all international connections from Airport to airport, and I do not have Schengen visa. All they said was that do you have any proof that you spoke with us. Really. Well, I dont because it was just a call with customer care, and I trusted what agent said and did not ask for the written proof. If I was having such trust issues with you, why would I even book with you at the first place? Anyway, now as a way forward I understand there is a problem with the ticket!  - Subsequently, on the day of boarding, I had asked Vayama and and Austrian Airlines to change my ticket, and re-route from (Delhi to Vienna to Chicago OR Delhi to Frankfurt to Chicago), that takes cares of travel documents, and just change half of my ticket and I was ready to pay any change penalty, but none of the parties changed my ticket. Change of ticket should not be that big a deal.  -  If there are such special restrictions (that themselves could not see or explain) as NON-CHANGEABLE then why arent they highlighted during the purchase like you highlight non-refundable or non-transferable. - I asked to cancel it and I am ready to pay the cancellation charges, they said we cannot. (Direct NO) - over and above that, there were 5 passengers that day on the SAME aircraft with this SAME problem, so I cant believe you guys as travel agent are selling such tickets without flagging the need of transit visa or immigration to the connections you are offering (it is such a small algorithm upgrade). You can argue that you never do that (because you have travel documents disclaimer in your T&C) but your senior executives should take a note that poor customers are being made victim to pay heavy price travel twice. Austrian executive say that airlines have been telling you not to sell such tickets (of course I know friendly chat between airlines and agent) and no strict ruling so that either of or agent takes responsibility.  - Austrian airlines person on duty there said we meet such passengers daily (why not do something about it). It is a scam going on with and Agent nexus. A BIG SCAM. One of the other victims was an old gentleman and was in worse situation than I was, as he couldnt even do all the running around that I was made to do by these parties in hand. Why wouldnt they stop it otherwise, after they see their passengers being put into such stalemate situation?   With all this my return ticket worth around $1000 got wasted and I had to buy a fresh ticket on the spot. You can imagine how costly it would be to buy on the spot India to Chicago ticket. And yes it was not a business trip, it was my personal expense, and I had to be in Chicago for my exams.   Further, agreed to refund a small amount of $130, and Vayama would be charging *change fee* $50, Change fee really?? That too refund in 60 days. Read their other reviews on trust pilot.   All three #Vayama, ##and Austrian airlines caused #harassment and repeatedly told to talk to other than themselves or to the agent. They suggested no solution, and took long wait time every time I had spoken to other party who had referred me back to them.   This was when I had made a 7 hour road trip to New Delhi Airport from my hometown, and it was the exercise from 11:00 PM to 4:00 AM. (Physically tiring and mentally harassed, and leave with no options AT ALL, *no show* for the  really!!). Since one week I have been repeatedly writing to them, none has made effort to talk or explain!!  I have documentation of all follow-up with date and time.     On our way home from vacation, we used Lufthansas services from Munich to Copenhagen. We checked in and at the check in we were told by a very service minded and friendly woman that she couldnt give us seats so that we could sit one grown up with one child each. She would send a message to the gate about it but at the gate we were told to talk to them on the plane. The plane was full and the staff told us that we had to see if any of the other passengers would change seats. So I had to ask out aloud in the plane about this, obviously annoying several passengers. This is not at all good service. We were very tired after a long nights travel and our boys are 6 and 8. In my book of service - and I work with many organizations - the staff should have helped us, which they didnt at all. Especially the young man at work were clearly irritated with me. Normally I would have reprimanded him but I was tired. He said that it was our problem that our boys were seated in the emergency seat, which - of course - it isnt. So we couldnt sit together and my complaint is that the service was so low and totally unexpected and not what I have previously experienced with  My boy who is 8 got 25F, which is really not for human. There is no window and most people would find it very unpleasant and noisy, I measured the noise there and the sound pressure was more than 94 db over a period of 10 minutes. THIS IS EXTREMELY UNHEALTHY, over 85db one should carry hearing protection. Other wise one can get permanent damage in the ears. Luckily there was one more seat free, so we could rearrange us. When I asked the young man about other seats, because we couldnt sit in 25F because of the noise, he said that unless there where one free I had to sit there. I noticed there was room in the business class and of course he should have offered me this without blinking an eye. I look forward to a good explanation that in some way can shed a light on this strange, unpleasant and bad service that clearly doesnt put in a favorable light.  And I wonder if what I and my family experienced really lives up to the values you work after in  It says on your homepage that you want to continually improve customer satisfaction so now you have a good chance depending on your response to me. Furthermore the experience that the staff didnt take on the proper leadership in their roles and helped us solve the problem, but actually GAVE us problems because of their unprofessional behavior, looks like a burden to   Best regards, Psychologist Peter Kim Wittenburg  Danish Institute for Personal Leadership  and Emotional Health  www.     delayed my suitcase for security reasons, such that it didnt make it to the destination. Since I was not able to collect it the next day, i told the ground handling representatives to send it my next destination a couple of days later. for some reason the suitcase only made it there while i was already on the plane for my next destination. I then told them to send the suitcase back to Copenhagen, where I live.  I received my suitcase only 1½ months later, after i was contacted by SAS. During this period I tried contacting both missing luggage center and their costumer service, but neither of them replied to my messages. I was not compensated either for the items i was forced to buy as a result and for the 1½ months I spent without the content of the suitcase.  Disrespectful and unacceptable!     On a trip from Copenhagen to Lyon over Frankfurt  The trip start with a 15 min delay from Copenhagen, due to late arrival from previous destination in Frankfurt, they park the plane some 12 minutes bus trip to the terminal, which leaves 18 min to change plane.  As usual, the plane are not on time, and the connecting is not even arrived to Frankfurt. We end with almost 40 minutes in Frankfurt, even they now had almost the same amount of time between planes in Frankfurt as planned, and they manage to mislay many suitcases, which create a chaos in Lyon airport when 10% of the plane do not get their suitcase.  And to make it all the better, the baggage tracking system in Lyon is down, so they cant make an electronic ticket which mean you dont get a luggage id you can trace, after just over 6 hours later the suitcases arrive at the hotel.  On the return trip, they start with a 45 minutes delay from Lyon, due to late departure from Frankfurt.  Which mean with bus transfer we arrive at the terminal at Frankfurt 12 minutes after the connection to Copenhagen has left the airport.  They have automatic rebooked us to, no not the next plane 1 hour later, but a plane 3 hours and 35 minutes later. We now have to wait in queue for 30 minutes at the service center to get new boarding cards and meal ticket, but not automatically, we have to arguing with them about the laws in EU concerning air transport for another 12 minutes, then we get the meal vouchers.  Afterwards we try to get in contact with get the 250 € per person back due to more than 3 hours delayed arrival at end destination, it is impossible. They do not reply on mails and you can only call them, to reserve a ticket not to complain.  If just the same people handling complains was handling reservation we would not I a million years have used at the first place.     My family and I (we are from Denmark) were going on a holiday to Mallorca. We flew  started in Hamburg, had a short transfer in Dusseldorf and landed in Mallorca - really simple. But no! Our from Hamburg was delayed 30 min., and our from Dusseldorf to Hamburg was delayed for 60 min. Even though we were delayed for such a long time, we only got information about the delay, in German - and my family and I do not speak any German. On our way home, the from Mallorca to Dusseldorf was, again, delayed for 60 min., so meant that we almost missed our connection to Hamburg. When we finally landed in Hamburg, we waited for our luggage for 30 min., finally a woman (speaking German) showed up and told my family and I that our luggage was left in Dusseldorf.. Naturally we were upset, since all of our stuff was in those suitcases, and we had to drive all the way back from Germany to Denmark, without our things.. We were promised by  that they would deliever it to us the next day.. Only 4 out of 6 suitcases showed up, and now does not know, where the two missing ones are. The people at has been nothing but really unprofesional and rude, since they dont really want to help us, and there English is so bad. None of them can help us, and they dont wanna give us any vouchers, for us to buy the most necessary things - even though THEY have lost OUR bags. I would never ever recommed this company to anyone.     English: My girlfriend and I were stranded in NY during Hurricane \"Sandy\" we should have been home the same day it arrived, we phoned the and were told we had to go to the airport to get vouchers for a hotel and food even though the hurricane was upon us. So we did that right away and when we arrived at the airport the airport  was closed and we could do nothing. We went to the nearest hotel and called once again told us that we could just check in and order something to eat they would refund our money when we got home again. All in all, while we sat at a small hotel and rode the storm out we were rebooked about 8 times when we finally had been told we had been booked on a plane, we went to the airport and was told that we never had a place on the plane and they couldnt do anything about it, it was only when they saw that my girlfriend was 6 months pregnant that we were put standby for a SAS we got on the plane as the last two persons. So all in all a terrible experience we have not seen our money yet and we contacted right after we came home from the U.S. in early November its now the 22 of february 3 months later1  Dansk: Min kæreste og jeg strandede i NY under orkanen \"Sandy\" vi skulle have været hjemme samme dag den ankom, vi ringede til og fik at vide vi skulle tage i lufthavnen for at få vouchers til hotel og mad selv om orkanen var over os. Det gjorde vi så med det samme og da vi ankom der ude var lufthavnen lukket og vi kunne intet gøre. Vi tog til det nærmeste hotel og ringede endnu engang til som fortalte os at vi bare kunne tjekke ind og betale mad de skulle nok sørge for at refundere vores penge når vi kom hjem. Alt i alt mens vi sad på et lille hotelværelse og red stormen ud, blev vi ombooket ca 8 gange da vi endelig havde fået at vide vi var kommet på et fly, tog vi til lufthavnen og fik at vide at vi aldrig nogensinde havde haft en plads på flyet og de ikke kunne gøre noget, det var først da de så at min kæreste var gravid i 6 måned at vi blev sat standby til et SAS fly og kom heldigvis med som de sidste på det fly. Så alt i alt en frygtelig oplevelse vi har ikke set skyggen af vores penge endnu og vi rettede henvendelse lige efter vi kom hjem fra USA i starten af november måned. Det er nu 22 februar 3 måneder senere.     They were unhelpful when I tried to change a booking and the on-board service was unfriendly and inadequate     i was taken a with from dublin to frankfurt on friday 6th july, when i got to the security at the airport i was informed the was cancelled, i had recieved a text confirming my  but nothing it had been cancelled, i had to buy a new ticket at the cost of €845, and told that the money would be refunded within 14 days, that was the 6th of this month, have sent mails to but havnt even had reply... so much for there customer service.they say you will get a reply within 24 to 48hrs. (more like days.) would think twice before ever using there service again. there was NO body at the airport to inform people what was happening. it was just terrible. then when we did get away with another  on the trip they had cancelled my ticket, because i did not use the outbound and spent just 2hrs at there desks trying to explain to them what was going on............... o never again.     I would never reccomend  their agreement with expedia is very blurry and not clear and if anything goes wrong with the booking the play the blame game and the only person who ends up paying more is the customer!     I fly often, and choose more than half of the time. I find it very reliable and with relatively low prices when booking online some time in advance.  The only reason I dont vie 5 stars is that the online pricing can be confusing, since they full price including all fees (which can be half of the ticket price) is not given until the very end of the booking cycle. Thus it is very difficult to compare prices with other airlines in searches.     Ive flown twice with Luffthansa (I had no choice the second time) and on both occasions they have been delayed taking off, missing my connections and being rude at the connection desk and then losing my luggage. Twice in a row! Either I am terribly unlucky or they are terrible.     Very nice service on board. No complaints!  But to book a 9 hour from Frankfurt to Denver, and not being told, that there are NO inflight entertainment system at your seat.  Thats a very looong ..    Get rid of the old planes, especially on the long haul flights.     I misinterpretated the following contradictorary terms A cancellation fee of USD 39.00 will be charged if you cancel your reservation or take no action within the 48 hour time limit.\"  I took action to cancel the booking within 48 hours and a RMB 250 charge was imposed against my cancellation.  If wants to make money from this \"additional\" service, why not states at the upfront that a non-refundable booking fee will be charged.  Once you make the booking, you could not make any change.  What you could do is to complete the transcation or pay the RMB 250 for doing nothing.  What is the added value of this \"additional\" service?'"
