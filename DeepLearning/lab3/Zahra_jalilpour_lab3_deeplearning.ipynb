To give an example, consider the  sentence *Parker hates parsnips*. In this sentence, the word *Parker* should be labelled as a proper noun (a noun that is the name of a person), *hates* should be labelled as a verb, and *parsnips* should be labelled as a (common) noun. Part-of-speech tagging is an essential ingredient of many state-of-the-art natural language understanding systems.\n",

Transparency should increse and manipulating issues related to society should reduce.\n"
